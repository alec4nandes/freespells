The second\r\neffigy is of the donor.<BR>\r\nThat can be put into an ordinary kitchen bowl as well.<BR>\r\nNext a series of things in a backwards-seeming order is performed.<BR>\r\nFirst, holding the effigy of the other person, the characteristics\r\nof the other person<BR>\r\nare invoked into it. It\'s then stuck into its bowl and sealed\r\nin its circle; let\'s call it circle B.<BR>\r\nThen the donor\'s effigy has the donor\'s characteristics invoked\r\ninto it and it is sealed into circle A.<BR>\r\nThe link connecting the two persons is then *evoked* from inside\r\nthe donor,<BR>\r\nwith them calling it forth and projecting it into the line connecting\r\nthe two circles.<BR>\r\nThen with some convenient wand or kitchen spoon or something,\r\ntap the line<BR>\r\nconnecting the two circles, invoking the line to represent the\r\nbond between the two.<BR>\r\nThen after walking three times around the whole contraption, counterclockwise\r\nand<BR>\r\nmake drawing gestures with the wand, kitchen spoon, laser pointer,\r\netc. the force<BR>\r\nlinking the two is commanded to decouple and withdraw from the\r\nline into the<BR>\r\nseparate sealed circles. Then the line is broken physically with\r\nthe wand, laser<BR>\r\npointer, whatever and the link is commanded to break and not reform.<BR>\r\nRemaining are two potentized effigies in separate sealed circles.<BR>\r\nIt\'s finished up by taking salt water (Epsom salts are nice) and\r\nbanishing any<BR>\r\nconnection that the donor effigy has with the donor by pouring\r\nthe salt water over<BR>\r\nit without breaking the circle A, while commanding any connection\r\nbe dissipated harmlessly.<BR>\r\nThen cooking wine is poured into the other bowl in circle B and\r\na match is tossed in<BR>\r\nand the command is given for any link that the effigy has with\r\nthe other person to be<BR>\r\ncleanly and harmlessly consumed by the flame .

Lay it between\r\nthe candles and<BR>\r\nallow them to burn until half gone charging and meditating on\r\nthe purpose of the spell<BR>\r\nall the while! Store the candles somewhere secure to use later\r\nwhen finishing the spell.<BR>\r\nThen place the envelope under the mattress of the &quot;ill&quot;\r\nperson or recipient of the spell if<BR>\r\npossible. You may also, if it is not possible to put it with the\r\nperson, place it behind a<BR>\r\npicture of the person in a frame; inside of a book they gave you,\r\netc., You can also<BR>\r\ninclude nail and hair clippings if you like or what you will.<BR>\r\nLet this stay undisturbed for as long as needed but it should\r\nnot exceed one full lunar cycle.<BR>\r\nWhen the magic has run it\'s course and the deed is accomplished,\r\nor when the cycle is<BR>\r\ndone light the remainder of the candles and set your circle or\r\nprepare as you did before.<BR>\r\nThen open the envelope and put everything on your altar, between\r\nthe candles in a fire<BR>\r\nproof bowl. First burn the slip of paper with the writing along\r\nwith the herbs and the hair,<BR>\r\nnails, etc., if you included them in the spell, then burn the\r\ndoll. As the doll burns it will turn<BR>\r\nfrom black to white (great sympathetic stuff here)! As you burn\r\nthese things be sure to keep<BR>\r\nfocused on the intent (such as banishing the illness, visualize\r\nthe person whole and healthy,<BR>\r\nno longer addicted, etc.) Scrape all of the ashes back into the\r\nenvelope and use some of the<BR>\r\ncandle wax to seal it up again. You can carve symbols in the wax\r\nif you like.<BR>\r\nBe sure to, get rid of everything which you used with this ritual\r\n(candle nubs, any<BR>\r\nremaining bits of herbs, the pen, etc., you should not have to\r\nget rid of the incense or oil<BR>\r\nas you should have used it anyhow). Bury or otherwise dispose\r\nof the envelope, far away<BR>\r\nfrom anyone\'s home or property.<BR>\r\n*Flash paper (the kind magicians use) is great to use for the\r\npaper, just be sure the paper is<BR>\r\nsafely in the dish before lighting it! This shows the problem\r\nproperly vanishing in a flash and<BR>\r\nthe doll burns removing the black and turning to white.<BR>\r\n**Use extreme caution with Asafoetida, just a whiff of this herb\r\nhas been known to cause<BR>\r\nvomiting, better to substitute Valerian.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">CORD MAGICK<BR>\r\nItems needed: basic altar set up, 13 inches of cord or thread\r\nin color symbolic of need.<BR>\r\nShield, ground and center, cast circle.

As you go, chant:<BR>\r\n&quot;Negativity be gone.&quot;<BR>\r\nCome back into the Circle and visualize your entire house and\r\nyard bathed in a peaceful blue light.<BR>\r\nSince you have created a void by banishing the negativity, you\r\nwill need to fill that void.<BR>\r\nAsk that good, protective spirits come into your home and that\r\npositive energies replace the<BR>\r\nnegative ones that have just been banished. This is an important\r\nstep, because if you don\'t<BR>\r\nfill the void with something good, the negativity will come right\r\nback.<BR>\r\nSometimes during such a ritual, I take one large and one small\r\nblack stone and charge<BR>\r\nthem to keep away negativity. I promise Hecate that the large\r\none will remain in a prominent<BR>\r\nplace in my house and that I will keep the small one with me at\r\nall times. Thank Hecate.<BR>\r\nMeditate if you wish, visualizing your life free from negative\r\nhappenings and feelings and<BR>\r\nfull of love, prosperity, and happiness.

Surround the base of the\r\ncandles with the<BR>\r\nappropriate herbs and light the candles, cast your circle or otherwise\r\nprepare for<BR>\r\nmagic as you normally would.<BR>\r\nCut a human figure out of the carbon paper (designed appropriately\r\nas specifically<BR>\r\nmale for men, female for women) that will fit inside the envelope.\r\nOf course, if you<BR>\r\nneed to, you can use a larger envelope but the business size is\r\ngenerally sufficient.<BR>\r\nLay the figure on the slip of paper between the candles, charge\r\nand name it as the<BR>\r\nindividual and with intent write on the figure what you are working\r\non. Such as, if the<BR>\r\nspell is to heal an illness you might simply write whatever that\r\nillness is, in example:<BR>\r\n&quot;cold/flu.&quot; You might also write it over the appropriate\r\nbody part, such as if it is a<BR>\r\nhead cold write it on the head. If it\'s to overcome an addiction\r\nto cigarettes you<BR>\r\nmight write &quot;cigarettes&quot; on the chest (or where ever\r\nyou identify most with smoking)<BR>\r\nand even add a cigarette in the envelope! Be creative with it.<BR>\r\nCharge both the paper and the doll with intent, by the elements,\r\netc., and place them<BR>\r\nand some of the herbs in the envelope and seal it up. Lay it between\r\nthe candles and<BR>\r\nallow them to burn until half gone charging and meditating on\r\nthe purpose of the spell<BR>\r\nall the while! Store the candles somewhere secure to use later\r\nwhen finishing the spell.<BR>\r\nThen place the envelope under the mattress of the &quot;ill&quot;\r\nperson or recipient of the spell if<BR>\r\npossible. You may also, if it is not possible to put it with the\r\nperson, place it behind a<BR>\r\npicture of the person in a frame; inside of a book they gave you,\r\netc., You can also<BR>\r\ninclude nail and hair clippings if you like or what you will.<BR>\r\nLet this stay undisturbed for as long as needed but it should\r\nnot exceed one full lunar cycle.<BR>\r\nWhen the magic has run it\'s course and the deed is accomplished,\r\nor when the cycle is<BR>\r\ndone light the remainder of the candles and set your circle or\r\nprepare as you did before.<BR>\r\nThen open the envelope and put everything on your altar, between\r\nthe candles in a fire<BR>\r\nproof bowl. First burn the slip of paper with the writing along\r\nwith the herbs and the hair,<BR>\r\nnails, etc., if you included them in the spell, then burn the\r\ndoll. As the doll burns it will turn<BR>\r\nfrom black to white (great sympathetic stuff here)! As you burn\r\nthese things be sure to<BR>\r\nkeep focused on the intent (such as banishing the illness, visualize\r\nthe person whole<BR>\r\nand healthy, no longer addicted, etc.) Scrape all of the ashes\r\nback into the envelope<BR>\r\nand use some of the candle wax to seal it up again. You can carve\r\nsymbols in the wax if you like.<BR>\r\nBe sure to, get rid of EVERYTHING which you used with this ritual\r\n(candle nubs, any<BR>\r\nremaining bits of herbs, the pen, etc., you should not have to\r\nget rid of the incense or<BR>\r\noil as you should have used it anyhow). Bury or otherwise dispose\r\nof the envelope, far<BR>\r\naway from anyone\'s home or property.<BR>\r\n*Flash paper (the kind magicians use) is great to use for the\r\npaper, just be sure the paper<BR>\r\nis safely in the dish before lighting it! This shows the problem\r\nproperly vanishing in a flash<BR>\r\nand the doll burns removing the black and turning to white.<BR>\r\n**Use extreme caution with Asafoetida, just a whiff of this herb\r\nhas been known to cause<BR>\r\nvomiting, better to substitute Valerian<BR>\r\nIts a deadly little number so be sure about casting it as what\r\ngoes out comes back 3x3.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">7 DAY BANISHMENT OF NEGATIVITY<BR>\r\nThis is a Banishment of negativity spell, but a 7 day candle spell\r\ncan be used for other<BR>\r\nworkings, like prosperity, health, love etc. (on different days\r\nof the week)<BR>\r\nThis should be undertaken on Saturday (Saturn), and if you want\r\nto be more precise,<BR>\r\nthe use Saturn\'s hour. You can either choose 12-1 (from midnight)\r\n7-8 am or (from noon)<BR>\r\n2-3 PM and 8-9 PM. It doesn\'t matter what time you finish, just\r\nstart at the proper time.<BR>\r\nDo this spell during the waning Moon towards the last quarter.\r\nBanishment spells<BR>\r\nare done during the Waning Moon because you want to stifle the\r\nnegativity.<BR>\r\nYou will need:<BR>\r\n1. Two regular white stick alter candles<BR>\r\n2. A glass enclosed candle that will burn for approx. one week.\r\nIf your local occult store<BR>\r\ncarries the reverse candle with black wax on top and white or\r\nred at the bottom, this would<BR>\r\nbe great, otherwise a black, brown, blue or purple is good since\r\nthese are some of Saturn\'s colors.<BR>\r\n3. Banishment or Uncrossing oil - or you can make it by taking\r\nthe herb of rosemary, black<BR>\r\ncoshosh, basil, eucalyptus, Vervain and sage (some or all) and\r\nputting them in some vegetable<BR>\r\nor olive oil and cooking them lightly for 5-10 minutes (don\'t\r\nburn), strain into a bottle or jar.<BR>\r\n4. Salt and water for sprinkling (consecration)<BR>\r\n5. Incense, a good quality<BR>\r\n6. Some parchment paper, but nice stationary will do (approx.\r\n3x3 piece)<BR>\r\nBefore you start your ritual you may want to air out your space\r\nwith sage.<BR>\r\nMake sure you air out the room with open windows and doors so\r\nnegative<BR>\r\nspirits can depart. This is optional, but a good idea. Be bathed\r\nand wear some uncrossing oil.<BR>\r\nWear your ritual clothes or clean garments. Your altar and ritual\r\narea should be tidy but<BR>\r\nhave your personal touch on it, with the things that represent\r\nyou.<BR>\r\nBegin by lighting your incense and sprinkle water and salt in\r\nthe 4 directions, move deosil,<BR>\r\nor clockwise (dispel). Offer a short prayer in your own words\r\nto the elements earth air fire<BR>\r\nand water to come to your space to purify it. You can include\r\nyour favorite wights or protectors.<BR>\r\nMake this as personal as possible. What matters is what \'you\'\r\nidentify with, not trying to<BR>\r\nidentify with some entity you\'ve never heard of. Just be sincere,\r\nand visualize your space<BR>\r\nbeing protected. If you want to draw an imaginary circle moving\r\nclockwise, that\'s fine too,<BR>\r\nas long as you indicate the purification of your working space.<BR>\r\nAfter the consecration, light the two white alter candles (protectors)\r\nand offer an invocation/prayer<BR>\r\nto your main deity and in your own words ask him/her for protection\r\nand the banishment of all<BR>\r\nnegative entities that are troubling you, ask him/her to send\r\nthem back to their origin.<BR>\r\nThey have no place in your life. Ask for all harm to be turned\r\naway from you, leaving<BR>\r\nbehind only prosperity, happiness, courage, acceptance of transitions\r\nwithout doubt and<BR>\r\nfear, and control over your life.<BR>\r\nState that your external forces have no power over you. Again,\r\njust be sincere, and<BR>\r\nwhether you do this in a poem form or just simply state it doesn\'t\r\nmatter, just say it with conviction.<BR>\r\nAfter your invocation, take some banishment oil and &quot;charge&quot;\r\nthe top of your glass encased<BR>\r\ncandle with your finger tips, moving deosil, and offer a few words\r\nto remove and expel all<BR>\r\nthe negativity around you. Now light the candle.<BR>\r\nThe parchment paper is your seal. It serves as an amulet, talisman\r\nand charm, it will do the<BR>\r\nwork for you. There are many kinds of seals, but it can simply\r\nbe something you create.<BR>\r\nWrite your intent or wish on the paper, in this case the banishment\r\nof ill-forces and your<BR>\r\nprotection. Then put a few dabs of banishment oil on it and put\r\nit under your candle and<BR>\r\nleave it there until it burns out.<BR>\r\nWhen you\'ve finished with your seal, thank your deity and helpful\r\nspirits and ask them to<BR>\r\ndepart and do your bidding.<BR>\r\nClose the ritual by extinguishing your two main alter candles\r\n(never blow on the fire element).<BR>\r\nYour 7 day candle will stay lit until it burns out, so you may\r\nwant to have it in an extra glass<BR>\r\nor metal bowl for safety\'s sake, and out of reach for anyone to\r\ntouch (including Freyja).<BR>\r\nThis is the end of you ritual. Now evening until the candle burns\r\nout, pick a certain time<BR>\r\nand stick to it, to sit down with your candle anywhere from 15\r\n-30 minutes and seriously<BR>\r\nand intently focus or meditate on your wish or expectation. It\'s\r\nalways good to start with<BR>\r\na prayer or chant, this depends on you particular spiritual practice\r\nand whatever suits you.<BR>\r\nNever miss a single day. If more than one of you is doing this\r\nritual, you must all sit together<BR>\r\neach evening for the candle visualization and stick to it.<BR>\r\nWhen the candle finally burns out (7 days, sooner or later), take\r\nthe seal and burn it, and<BR>\r\nsprinkle the ashes outside your front door and forget about it.\r\nYou have banished all the ill<BR>\r\nforces around you, go confidently about your daily life.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">TO BANISH NEGATIVE FORMS FROM YOUR HOME AND\r\nYOURSELF<BR>\r\nBegin with a purification bath.<BR>\r\nLight the twin candles on the altar and burn a protective and/or\r\ncleansing incense.<BR>\r\nFill your chalice with freshwater (be sure to consecrate it) and\r\nblessed salt.<BR>\r\nKneel or assume the Goddess position as you say:<BR>\r\n&quot;Naked come I into this sanctuary With love and faith<BR>\r\nFrom those who have gone before.

In a way, you are negating\r\nthe unhealthy energy.<BR>\r\nThe most important thing to remember when conducting a binding\r\nspell is that you must control<BR>\r\nyour own violent emotions of hatred or fear. The binding spell\r\nis for protection only, not for harm.<BR>\r\nThis is not easy. The Goddess to be employed is Aradia, Queen\r\nof Witches.<BR>\r\nBe sure you are honest in your intentions. Aradia\'s symbol is\r\nthe red garter.<BR>\r\nIf you desire justice call upon Maat, she who balances the scales.<BR>\r\nHowever, you must be sure that your own hands are free from<BR>\r\nviolence &amp; hatred, lest she weighs the scales for you as well!<BR>\r\nHer symbol is the pure white feather.<BR>\r\nThe binding itself is a very simple matter. A puppet can be sewn\r\nto represent the malicious person.<BR>\r\nFill it with earth (grave dirt if you can find it), rosemary,\r\nsage, a piece of smoky quartz &amp; a piece of amethyst.<BR>\r\nAlso enclose a piece of the person\'s fingernails, a lock of hair,\r\nor another personal item.<BR>\r\nHandwriting can be enclosed if you have nothing else.<BR>\r\nPhotos can be used also. If your intention at any time during\r\nthe ritual is to harm that person,<BR>\r\nremember that you will only bring harm upon yourself - so be very,\r\nvery careful.<BR>\r\nIf you can\'t do the ritual right away, store the doll (with the\r\nhead still open) in a white cloth.<BR>\r\nDuring the ritual, you will sew up the head while connecting a\r\npsychic link.<BR>\r\nThen you will proceed to sew arms &amp; legs of the doll together.<BR>\r\nYou will finish by wrapping the doll mummy-fashion with a black\r\nribbon.<BR>\r\nBury the doll when you have completed the ritual.<BR>\r\nA person can also be bound using mental capabilities.<BR>\r\nPlacing a sample of a person\'s handwriting &amp; copper tightly\r\nin an old bell jar is a way of<BR>\r\nstopping malicious gossip. When the danger is over, burn the handwriting.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">A SPELL TO BIND BULLIES<BR>\r\nYou Need: 3 black candles black thread one black pen a piece of\r\npaper an empty glass jar<BR>\r\nThis spell will not hurt your bully, it will just make them leave\r\nyou alone.<BR>\r\nDo this spell at midnight on a Saturday of a waning moon<BR>\r\n(a period of time between a full moon and a new moon, the light\r\nis decreasing.<BR>\r\nThe opposite is the waxing moon, when the moon is moving from\r\na new moon to a full).<BR>\r\nSet the candles in a big triangle shape, big enough so that you\r\ncan sit in the middle.<BR>\r\nLight the candles. Write the bully\'s name on the paper, and draw\r\nan &quot;X&quot; over it.<BR>\r\nFold it three times. Say:<BR>\r\n&quot;I bind you (say their name)<BR>\r\nso that you cannot hurt me anymore,<BR>\r\nboth physically, and emotionally.<BR>\r\nGet out of my life, leave me alone.<BR>\r\nI bind you (say name) I bind you.&quot;<BR>\r\nThen tie the thread around the folded paper, and pop it in the\r\njar. Screw on the lid.<BR>\r\nSnuff out the candles (never, NEVER blow out candles after a spell,\r\nit pushes the<BR>\r\nmagick away). The next day, bury the jar off you property, or\r\nyou can hide it in a closet<BR>\r\nwhere it will not be found. If the black candles you used are\r\nsmall enough, you can put<BR>\r\nthem in the jar (do this at the end of the spell, not after you\r\nhave screwed the lid on).<BR>\r\nIf not, burn them later until there is nothing left of them.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">BASIC BINDING<BR>\r\nYou can just write their name and wrap it in black cord, ribbon,\r\nthread, yarn,<BR>\r\nwith intention, or freeze it in an ice cube tray.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">SPELL BINDER<BR>\r\nThis is best used at the end of a spoken or written spell.<BR>\r\nThis adds a certain boost to the releasing of energy.<BR>\r\nIt also works best if you are wearing a Pentagram you have attuned\r\nto yourself.<BR>\r\nSpeak these word with all the fibers of your body while releasing\r\nthe spell\'s energy:<BR>\r\nBy the Pentagram I wear,<BR>\r\nWater, Fire, Earth, and Air,<BR>\r\nRuled by Spirit as All should be<BR>\r\nAs I speak So Mote It Be!</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">AN ALL PURPOSE SPELL TO EFFECT ANOTHER<BR>\r\nThis simple spell can be used for any purpose - whether it be\r\nto empower a person,<BR>\r\nto heal them, to bind them etc. Simply choose the appropriate\r\ncolor candle and scribe<BR>\r\nthe person\'s name and your intent upon it.

Each night\r\nfor three nights, burn<BR>\r\nabout a third of the candle.<BR>\r\nWhile the candle is burning, visualize positive outcomes (such\r\nas a move to a new location for<BR>\r\nthe other party, a move to a new location for you, successful\r\nmediation of a problem, etc.) and<BR>\r\nhow the situation can get reversed for the good of you and any\r\nother individuals who may be<BR>\r\ninvolved (children, elderly parents, etc.) including the individual\r\nwho\'s name is inscribed on the candle.<BR>\r\nWhen the candle is burned down to a stub dispose of it immediately\r\nby taking it to a body of fresh water.<BR>\r\nOnce the candle is in the water, turn and walk away. If it is\r\nwinter or if you can\'t get to fresh water<BR>\r\nthen bury it in the earth (not near your home) or dispose of it\r\nin a dumpster or some other waste<BR>\r\narea as far away from your home as possible.<BR>\r\nWhen you return to your home after the disposal, return by a different\r\nroute from the one you<BR>\r\ntook to get there. It is critical to think positively during the\r\nprocess. Negativity will bog the<BR>\r\nprocess down. Upon your return home create a positive spell outlining\r\nwhat you want the<BR>\r\nsituation to be -- use a white candle or one that represents the\r\npositive to you.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">HOW TO BREAK A JINX OR GET UNCROSSED<BR>\r\nIf you have been crossed or jinxed, or someone has put roots on\r\nyou, you may not know<BR>\r\nwho did it, but you may suspect and even be able to remember how\r\nit was done.<BR>\r\nOne common way to cross someone is to sprinkle Crossing Powder,\r\nHot Foot Powder,<BR>\r\nor Goofer Dust across their trackway or doorstep, or dress their\r\nsocks or shoes.<BR>\r\nI have even heard of women who will dress their own privates so\r\nthat a man will<BR>\r\ndrag himself in it and lose his nature or jinx up his love life.<BR>\r\nAnother way to fix a person is to get something personal of theirs\r\nand stop it up in a bottle<BR>\r\nwith roots and nails, pins, or needles. Your hair may have been\r\ngotten this way, or a piece<BR>\r\nof your clothing, or your personal concerns. This trick may have\r\nbeen done to you by an<BR>\r\nenemy to control you, dominate you, or get revenge on you by destroying\r\nyour happiness<BR>\r\nin love and money matters.<BR>\r\nFirst, if you have been having bad luck for a long time or are\r\nsuffering from an unnatural illness<BR>\r\nbut you have no known enemy and no one has ever openly declared\r\nthemselves against you,<BR>\r\ncheck around your home and see if you can find something that\r\nanyone could have secretly<BR>\r\nput there to jinx you, like burying something in your front yard.\r\nIf you find something, like a bottle<BR>\r\nwith personal effects, roots, or hairs in it, dig it up and burn\r\nit or throw it away in running water.<BR>\r\nIf you can\'t find such a thing, you may have been fixed with some\r\nmess sprinkled on your food<BR>\r\nor on your shoes.<BR>\r\nYou need to get 2 white offertory candles for uncrossing and some\r\nUncrossing oil to dress them.<BR>\r\nAlso, and this is important, before lighting the candles, I want\r\nyou to take a bath in some purifying<BR>\r\nherbs or Uncrossing type bath preparation. The hyssop herb bath\r\nis something you can make<BR>\r\nup yourself from hyssop leaves or you can buy ready-made Uncrossing\r\nBath Crystals with Hyssop,<BR>\r\nor -- for a really strong job -- you can use the 13 Herb Spiritual\r\nBath, which contains hyssop and<BR>\r\n12 other uncrossing herbs.<BR>\r\nMany folks use 13 packets of 13 Herb Spiritual Bath and take a\r\nbath every morning for a total<BR>\r\nof 13 days to clear away a really bad jinx. Hyssop is what is\r\nrecommended in the Bible for<BR>\r\npurification. (Look up the 51st Psalm; this is the one that tells\r\nyou how to use the hyssop<BR>\r\nbath. If you are not a Christian, you can still use the hyssop\r\nherb; it is traditional for<BR>\r\nuncrossing in any case.)<BR>\r\nTo prepare the bath, you either brew up the herbs into a tea and\r\nstrain it or dissolve the<BR>\r\nmineral crystals in warm water. Then you recite the 51st Psalm\r\n(or an uncrossing spell of<BR>\r\nyour choice) as you pour the bath water over your head. If you\r\nare taking the 13 Herb<BR>\r\nBath, you pour the water and recite the 51st Psalm 13 times for\r\neach morning\'s bath.<BR>\r\nWhen you have finished the bath, step out of the tub and light\r\nthe 2 white candles that<BR>\r\nhave been dressed with Uncrossing Oil. Stand between the candles.\r\nDo not dry yourself<BR>\r\nwith a towel -- let the bath water dry on you in the air as the\r\ncandles burn.<BR>\r\nNow recite the 37th Psalm, the one folks call &quot;The Uncrossing\r\npsalm.&quot;<BR>\r\nThis is the one that begins &quot;Fret not thyself with evil-doers...&quot;<BR>\r\nPinch out the candles (don\'t blow them out) if you intend to work\r\nthis spell for the<BR>\r\nfull 13 days. If you do will only be doing it for one day, just\r\nlet the candles burn until<BR>\r\nthey go out, no matter how long that takes.<BR>\r\nIf you are not a Christian, then instead of the 37th Psalm, just\r\nvoice your request in your<BR>\r\nown words that the jinx be lifted and the one who put it on you\r\nbe struck down.<BR>\r\nAfter taking this bath, some people then use the remaining bath\r\nwater to wash down their<BR>\r\nfloors and especially the doorstep of the house. Mix the bath\r\nwater into a bucket with some<BR>\r\nChinese Wash or Van Van Oil to make it stronger. Wash from the\r\nback of the premises to the<BR>\r\nfront. Sweep out the front doorway area while the floor is still\r\nwet. Once you are done with the<BR>\r\nwash water, carry whatever remains out of the house and pour it\r\non the ground outside<BR>\r\n(not down the drain).<BR>\r\nDo this every morning upon awakening -- bathing, praying, lighting\r\nthe white candles, and<BR>\r\nwashing down the house -- for 13 days and this will bring you\r\nrelief from crossed conditions.<BR>\r\nIf you know who has put this crossed condition on you and you\r\nwant to reverse the spell<BR>\r\nonto them, burn a black candle on their name (putting their name\r\non a paper beneath an<BR>\r\noverturned saucer under the candle) or carve their name on the\r\ncandle. If you use a black<BR>\r\ncandle in the figure of the Devil and carve their name on it,\r\ndress it with Cast Off Evil Oil and<BR>\r\nthings will go harder with them. If you don\'t know the name of\r\nthe person who did this trick to<BR>\r\nyou, carve the words &quot;My Enemy&quot; on the candle. Burn\r\nthe black candle on the toilet tank, a<BR>\r\nlittle bit each night, pinching it out between burnings. Burn\r\nit while the moon is growing smaller --<BR>\r\nand on the dark of the moon, the darkest night of the month, turn\r\nthe burning black candle<BR>\r\nupside down and extinguish it in the toilet bowl, saying<BR>\r\n&quot;Thus will you, [name of enemy], meet your fate!&quot;<BR>\r\nThrow the remaining black candle stub and wax into a crossroads\r\n-- or into the yard of the<BR>\r\nperson who had put the roots on you or jinxed you.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">SPELLTO REVERSE NEGATIVITY OR HEXES<BR>\r\nTry this spell to reverse any negativity or hexes being sent your\r\nway.<BR>\r\nVisualize all blocks in your life-path being removed.<BR>\r\nAnoint a purple candle with Rosemary oil.<BR>\r\nOn a piece of white paper write the following in black ink:<BR>\r\nAll blocks are now removed.<BR>\r\nFold the paper three times.

You may not<BR>\r\nknow who did it...but you may suspect and even be able to remember\r\nhow it was done.<BR>\r\nOne common way to cross someone is to sprinkle Crossing Powder,\r\nHot Foot Powder, or<BR>\r\nGoofer Dust across their trackway or doorstep, or dress their\r\nsocks or shoes.<BR>\r\nAnother way to fix a person is to get something personal of theirs\r\nand stop it up in a bottle<BR>\r\nwith roots and nails, pins, or needles. Your hair may have been\r\ngotten this way, or a piece<BR>\r\nof your clothing, or your personal concerns.

If you find<BR>\r\nsomething, like a bottle with personal effects, roots, or hairs\r\nin it, dig it up and burn it<BR>\r\nor throw it away in running water. Even if you can\'t find such\r\na thing, you may have<BR>\r\nbeen fixed with some mess sprinkled on your food or on your shoes.<BR>\r\nYou need to get 2 white offertory candles for uncrossing and some\r\nUncrossing oil to dress them.<BR>\r\nAlso, and this is important, before lighting the candles, take\r\na bath in some purifying<BR>\r\nherbs or Uncrossing type bath preparation. The hyssop herb bath\r\nis something you<BR>\r\ncan make up yourself from hyssop leaves or you can buy ready-made\r\nUncrossing<BR>\r\nBath Crystals with Hyssop, or -- for a really strong job -- you\r\ncan use the 13 Herb<BR>\r\nSpiritual Bath, which contains hyssop and 12 other uncrossing\r\nherbs.<BR>\r\nUse 13 packets of 13 Herb Spiritual Bath and take a bath every\r\nmorning for a<BR>\r\ntotal of 13 days to clear away a really bad jinx. Hyssop is what\r\nis recommended<BR>\r\nfor purification. Call upon the deity of your choice.<BR>\r\nTo prepare the bath, you either brew up the herbs into a tea and\r\nstrain it or dissolve<BR>\r\nthe mineral crystals in warm water. Then you recite an uncrossing\r\nspell of your choice<BR>\r\nas you pour the bath water over your head. If you are taking the\r\n13 Herb Bath, you<BR>\r\npour the water and recite your prayer13 times for each morning\'s\r\nbath.<BR>\r\nWhen you have finished the bath, step out of the tub and light\r\nthe 2 white candles<BR>\r\nthat have been dressed with Uncrossing Oil. Stand between the\r\ncandles. Do not dry<BR>\r\nyourself with a towel -- let the bath water dry on you in the\r\nair as the candles burn.<BR>\r\nRecite voice your request in your own words that the jinx be lifted\r\nand the one who<BR>\r\nput it on you be struck down. Pinch out the candles (don\'t blow\r\nthem out) if you intend<BR>\r\nto work this spell for the full 13 days. If you do ill only be\r\ndoing it for one day, just<BR>\r\nlet the candles burn until they go out, no matter how long that\r\ntakes.<BR>\r\nAfter taking this bath, some people then use the remaining bath\r\nwater to wash down<BR>\r\ntheir floors and especially the doorstep of the house. Mix the\r\nbath water into a bucket<BR>\r\nwith some Chinese Wash to make it even stronger. Wash from the\r\nback of the premises<BR>\r\nto the front. Sweep out the front doorway area while the floor\r\nis still wet. Once you are<BR>\r\ndone with the wash water, carry whatever remains out of the house\r\nand pour it on the<BR>\r\nground outside (not down the drain).<BR>\r\nDo this every morning upon awakening -- bathing, praying, lighting\r\nthe white candles,<BR>\r\nand washing down the house -- for 13 days and this will bring\r\nyou relief from crossed conditions.<BR>\r\nIf you know who has put this crossed condition on you and you\r\nwant to reverse the spell<BR>\r\nonto them, the best thing to hope for is to find the mess they\r\nput down -- whether that be<BR>\r\npowders, a doll, or a bottle spell. If you find it, just burn\r\nit all up or throw it into running water.<BR>\r\nNot only will this take the root work off of you, it will send\r\nit back to the one who sent it.<BR>\r\nMost times, unfortunately, you will not be able to find what they\r\nput down to hurt you.<BR>\r\nIn that case, one well-known way to reverse their work back onto\r\nthem is to burn a black<BR>\r\ncandle on their name (putting their name on a paper beneath an\r\noverturned saucer under<BR>\r\nthe candle) or carve their name on the candle.

Burn it while the moon is growing smaller --\r\nand on the dark of the moon,<BR>\r\nthe darkest night of the month, turn the burning black candle\r\nupside down and extinguish<BR>\r\nit in the toilet bowl, saying &quot;Thus will you, [name of enemy],\r\nmeet your fate!&quot;<BR>\r\nThrow the remaining black candle stub and wax into a crossroads\r\n-- or into the yard of the<BR>\r\nperson who had put the roots on you or jinxed you.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">A SIMPLE REVERSING SPELL<BR>\r\nFirst for this spell you will need:<BR>\r\n1 black and red reversing candle (You may find this in any occult\r\nsupply shop, botanica, etc.)<BR>\r\nor you may use 3 red household candles with the bottom portion\r\ndipped in black wax 1 bag of<BR>\r\nreversing bath salts (or you may use solar sea salt which you\r\nhave consecrated for this purpose)<BR>\r\n1 bag of reversing incense, 1 piece of virgin parchment, 1 vial\r\nof reversing oil India ink which<BR>\r\nhas been consecrated for this purpose, a quill pen to draw upon\r\nthe parchment.<BR>\r\nFirst you must bathe in water with the bath salts, allowing yourself\r\nto air dry after.<BR>\r\nNext, you dress your candle with the oil; anoint the candle starting\r\nin the center and rub the oil<BR>\r\ntowards each end (If using a jar candle anoint the top of the\r\nwax in a counter-clock-wise<BR>\r\ncircular motion, starting at the center and out). Write upon the\r\nparchment that which you<BR>\r\ndesire to be directed away from you in this case psychic attacks\r\n(if you know the source,<BR>\r\nwrite that too). Light the incense and pass the parchment through\r\nthe smoke, then place<BR>\r\nthe parchment under the candle. Light the candle while visualizing\r\na white ball of light forming<BR>\r\nabove it. Then say with all of the force of emotion that you can\r\nmuster:<BR>\r\n&quot;By incense\' smoke and candles\' flame,<BR>\r\nAway from me I send all bane;<BR>\r\nBy cleansing water and power of salt,<BR>\r\nLet any harm come to naught.<BR>\r\nTo any who would wish me pain,<BR>\r\nMay all their curses be in vain;<BR>\r\nAll that blocks me from success,<BR>\r\nWith this spell I lay to rest.<BR>\r\nHarm to None and Good to all,<BR>\r\nLord and Lady hear my call;<BR>\r\nAs I do will, So Mote It Be!&quot;<BR>\r\nRepeat this chant three times As you say the chant, imagine the\r\nsmall white ball above the<BR>\r\ncandle growing and expanding until it encompasses you and anyone\r\nelse who you desire to<BR>\r\nprotect. Imagine that any negative energy that meets this ball\r\nof light will be reflected off, never<BR>\r\ntouching you at all. After the candle has burnt out (about 6 or\r\n7 days for a jar), take the jar<BR>\r\nand any wax left over, and the parchment and place them in a brown\r\npaper bag. Take them<BR>\r\nto a remote location and break the jar inside the bag and dispose\r\nof it. As you dispose of it say:<BR>\r\n&quot;Return to the elements from which thou camest!&quot;<BR>\r\nAs you may have guessed, this is also a success spell in the form\r\nof reversing any negative<BR>\r\nenergies which may be blocking you from the success you desire,\r\nwhatever form that success<BR>\r\nwill take. As for the form of the success; leave that to the Gods.\r\nOh, and if you are using<BR>\r\nhousehold candles, remember to repeat the spell three nights in\r\nsuccession, burning each<BR>\r\ncandle and disposing of the remaining wax after all three have\r\nbeen burnt. This spell will bring<BR>\r\nyou much success and protection if done in the right way.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">REVERSING CROSSED CONDITIONS WITH A BLACK CANDLE<BR>\r\nIf you know who has put a crossed condition on you and you want\r\nto reverse the jinx onto them,<BR>\r\nburn a black candle on their name (putting their name on a paper\r\nbeneath an overturned saucer<BR>\r\nunder the candle) or carve their name on the candle.<BR>\r\nIf you don\'t know the name of the person who did this trick to\r\nyou, carve the words &quot;My Enemy&quot;<BR>\r\non the candle.

If you are plagued\r\nby evil spells and bad luck,<BR>\r\nthen do this powerful ancient Voodoo egg spell to help you remove\r\nany negative<BR>\r\nconditions from your life.<BR>\r\n1.

It is very important that\r\nthis egg be fresh.<BR>\r\nPlace this egg in a brown bag and tie the neck of the bag with\r\na black cloth string.<BR>\r\nPlace this bag under your bed.<BR>\r\n2. Each night before retiring to bed, you must open this bag and\r\ntake the egg out<BR>\r\nand rub it all over your body. When done, put the egg back into\r\nthe bag, take a<BR>\r\ndeep breath and blow three times into the bag. When you are blowing\r\ninto the bag,<BR>\r\nyou must imagine that all the bad luck is leaving your body, via\r\nyour breath.<BR>\r\nWhen done, place the bag back under your bed. Do this for nine\r\ndays.<BR>\r\nAt the end of nine days, take the bag with the egg and dispose\r\nof it outside your home.<BR>\r\n3. Note: Each time that you blow into the bag, you must immediately\r\ntie it back up.<BR>\r\nIf by the end of seven days you notice that your bag is moving\r\non it\'s own.<BR>\r\nStop, and dispose of the bag immediately.<BR>\r\nDO NOT LOOK INTO THE BAG. Make sure that the bag is secure.<BR>\r\nDo not play with this.

Do not use this marker for anything\r\nelse<BR>\r\nbut this type of spell if you can help it.) Also. if you have\r\naccess to any essential<BR>\r\noils, get some rue oil or get hold of some bulk rue ... and a\r\nsmall bottle of olive oil.<BR>\r\nA small candle holder and a clean piece of paper and a red pen\r\nto write with are<BR>\r\nthe next things.(again, a new pen if possible, saving it for this\r\ntype of spell. A good<BR>\r\nthing to do is to get a variety of colored pens to save for doing\r\nspecific spells.)<BR>\r\nMelt the black wax of the candle in a double boiler and dip the\r\nlower half of the red<BR>\r\ncandles in it, making the black wax coat the bottom half.<BR>\r\nOr, if you must, cover the lower half of the red candles with\r\nthe black magic marker.<BR>\r\nOn a night where you can block everyone out for a while, take\r\na bath with either sea<BR>\r\nsalt or regular salt (1 tsp. is enough) and a bit of rue oil or\r\nrue (cut or ground, doesn\'t matter).<BR>\r\nDo not towel dry yourself, go ahead and air dry.<BR>\r\n(You can wear whatever you normally wear to do spells, but you\r\ndefinitely want to air dry.)<BR>\r\nThen, get out the rue oil or, in a small bowl, mix 3 tablespoons\r\nof ground or cut rue and<BR>\r\n1 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil. Coat one candle with the oil or\r\noil-herb mixture, anointing<BR>\r\nfrom the middle out, going counter clockwise. Do the bottom half\r\nfirst, then the top.<BR>\r\nYou\'ll be doing this spell over three consecutive nights, so save\r\nthe rest of the candles and<BR>\r\nthe oil in a safe place. On the piece of paper, write down what\r\nyou\'d like to see reversed<BR>\r\nfrom you; i.e. bad luck in love, financial problems, trouble from\r\nan enemy, inability to find<BR>\r\nwhat you need in your life, etc. Get thoughtful and make sure\r\nit\'s something you really<BR>\r\nwant to send away. Place the piece of paper under the candle holder\r\n(it would probably<BR>\r\nbe smart to put this in a pie plate or some other fireproof container),\r\ncharge the candle with<BR>\r\nyour desire to see these things or trends gone, and light the\r\ncandle, using a lighter only (no matches).<BR>\r\nDo this again for the next two nights, and once you\'re done, burn\r\nthe piece of paper, seeing your life<BR>\r\nas if a weight lifted from it. If there\'s any leftover wax, collect\r\nit in a brown paper bag and bury that<BR>\r\nsomeplace far from you, or throw in a trash can across town! Then\r\nforget about it, don\'t worry over<BR>\r\nit, just know it worked. You can do this whenever you feel the\r\nthings in your life are not going the<BR>\r\ndirection you\'d wish, and different candle colors can be used\r\nfor specific reversals.<BR>\r\nThis is for general, overall reversals.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">BREAKING A MAGICAL BOND WITH ANOTHER PERSON<BR>\r\nSecond, if a person wanted to try a link-break, they would have\r\nto evoke the bond again<BR>\r\n[to break it] ... They could use a simple sorcerous ceremony to\r\nevoke the link. ...<BR>\r\nGet a private room, and draw a diagram on a surface you can stand\r\nand walk around on.<BR>\r\nThey\'d diagram out a central circle one pace in diameter.<BR>\r\nThen they\'d draw another circle about one pace in diameter.<BR>\r\nThen they\'d connect the two circles with a line.<BR>\r\nOn one side of the line would be written the person\'s name.<BR>\r\nOne the other side of the line would be written the other person\'s\r\nname.<BR>\r\nNext two effigies would be prepared. A photograph with a name\r\nwritten on it is nice.<BR>\r\nPeople with old fashioned leanings can make them out of clay or\r\nwax.<BR>\r\nWith some caballa one could make them out writings on sheets of\r\npaper.<BR>\r\nOne effigy is for the person linked to. It\'s put in a bowl or\r\nsomething that cooking wine<BR>\r\ncan burn safely in, like an aluminum kitchen bowl. The second\r\neffigy is of the donor.<BR>\r\nThat can be put into an ordinary kitchen bowl as well.<BR>\r\nNext a series of things in a backwards-seeming order is performed.<BR>\r\nFirst, holding the effigy of the other person, the characteristics\r\nof the other person<BR>\r\nare invoked into it. It\'s then stuck into its bowl and sealed\r\nin its circle; let\'s call it circle B.<BR>\r\nThen the donor\'s effigy has the donor\'s characteristics invoked\r\ninto it and it is sealed into circle A.<BR>\r\nThe link connecting the two persons is then *evoked* from inside\r\nthe donor,<BR>\r\nwith them calling it forth and projecting it into the line connecting\r\nthe two circles.<BR>\r\nThen with some convenient wand or kitchen spoon or something,\r\ntap the line<BR>\r\nconnecting the two circles, invoking the line to represent the\r\nbond between the two.<BR>\r\nThen after walking three times around the whole contraption, counterclockwise\r\nand<BR>\r\nmake drawing gestures with the wand, kitchen spoon, laser pointer,\r\netc. the force<BR>\r\nlinking the two is commanded to decouple and withdraw from the\r\nline into the<BR>\r\nseparate sealed circles. Then the line is broken physically with\r\nthe wand, laser<BR>\r\npointer, whatever and the link is commanded to break and not reform.<BR>\r\nRemaining are two potentized effigies in separate sealed circles.<BR>\r\nIt\'s finished up by taking salt water (Epsom salts are nice) and\r\nbanishing any<BR>\r\nconnection that the donor effigy has with the donor by pouring\r\nthe salt water over<BR>\r\nit without breaking the circle A, while commanding any connection\r\nbe dissipated harmlessly.<BR>\r\nThen cooking wine is poured into the other bowl in circle B and\r\na match is tossed in<BR>\r\nand the command is given for any link that the effigy has with\r\nthe other person to be<BR>\r\ncleanly and harmlessly consumed by the flame . Then the mess is\r\ncleaned up in a normal way.<BR>\r\nIf you should happen to do this, you do it at your own risk, and\r\nare fully responsibility for<BR>\r\nwhatever happens. It\'s a good idea to experiment with cooking\r\nspirits beforehand in a<BR>\r\ncontrolled manner to determine what kind and amount and lighting\r\ntechnique is most<BR>\r\nadvisable in individual circumstances.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">SEPARATION<BR>\r\nWhen we share intimate relationships with people, often we unconsciously\r\ntake on some of<BR>\r\nour partner\'s traits and visa versa. In a close relationship this\r\ncan deepen the connection and<BR>\r\nallow two people to function and relate more easily as one. However\r\nthis condition is not<BR>\r\ndesirable because it ultimately weakens both parties involved.\r\nPieces of your soul become<BR>\r\nartificially incorporated into other people and visa versa.<BR>\r\nSo if the relationship breaks by any circumstance, both parties\r\nmay feel as though they\'re<BR>\r\nmissing parts of themselves, and also are haunted with some of\r\npieces of the other\'s behaviors,<BR>\r\nthinking and emotional patterns, etc. Now, your soul is linked\r\nto you no matter where it has<BR>\r\nbeen stretched to. There are always threads leading back to the\r\nsource which can never<BR>\r\n(or only with deliberate effort) be wholly severed. So by breathing\r\nwith those threads, it is<BR>\r\npossible to retract the lost parts of yourself, and release the\r\nparts which are not yours to keep.<BR>\r\nDo this as follows.<BR>\r\nMEDITATION<BR>\r\nLocate your center. Reach within and locate what is not you.<BR>\r\nExhale and release this out back into the world.<BR>\r\nReach out and feel the scattered bits of yourself.<BR>\r\nInhale and feel those pieces retract back into your center.<BR>\r\nRepeat until ending of meditation. Center yourself again and sit\r\nfor a minute to relax.<BR>\r\nDo this daily until you feel whole again and not psychically attached\r\nto any external persons.<BR>\r\nYou will find that there are far more than just one single person\r\nwho has bits of you out there,<BR>\r\nand far more than just one other person who you\'ve detained within.\r\nIt\'s a form of psychic<BR>\r\nparasitism that almost all people unconsciously partake in on\r\na continual basis (some<BR>\r\nconsciously as well). By doing the above exercise you will reconsolidate\r\nyourself.<BR>\r\nAfter this has happened you will become better rooted with a much\r\nstronger sense of personal<BR>\r\nboundaries, and you can thus better protect yourself from future\r\noccurrences.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">WHEN CURSED BY UNKNOWN PERSON<BR>\r\nSpell and magick be gone (say this three times)<BR>\r\nThat has been placed on me by person(s) known or unknown to me<BR>\r\nGo back from whence you came<BR>\r\nRemain with whom you came from<BR>\r\nBe with who you were sent by<BR>\r\nThen visualize a pyramid going over you.<BR>\r\nI am under universal light and universal protection<BR>\r\nNothing less then universal perfection can touch me were I am<BR>\r\nThe forces of this spell do leave So mote it be.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">9/9/01<BR>\r\n</FONT>\r\n\r\n</BODY>',

The different colors of\r\ncandles each have their own symbolism.<BR>\r\nHere is a table of the colors and their meanings.<BR>\r\nWhite: truth, purity<BR>\r\nRed: love, health, sex, strength<BR>\r\nGreen: money, luck, fertility<BR>\r\nBlack: discord, evil, negativity, confusion<BR>\r\nBrown: neutrality, uncertainty, hesitation<BR>\r\nPink: love, morality, honor<BR>\r\nPurple: power, business progress, ambition<BR>\r\nOrange: attraction, stimulation<BR>\r\nGreenish Yellow: jealousy, anger, discord<BR>\r\nGray: neutrality, stalemate, negativity<BR>\r\nLight Blue: tranquility, patience, health<BR>\r\nDark Blue: depression, changeability<BR>\r\nCandle spells can be very easy or complicated.<BR>\r\nIt all depends on how much time you want to put into a ritual.<BR>\r\nIt can be as simple as lighting a green candle and chanting...\r\nmoney money come to me.<BR>\r\nIt can also be very long and complicated lasting several days\r\nwith the repositioning of<BR>\r\nthe candles each day. The choice is always yours.<BR>\r\nThe first thing you want to do is get the appropriate color candles\r\nfor your particular desire.<BR>\r\nThen you need to anoint the candle with oil. Olive oil will do\r\nfine.<BR>\r\nYou need to rub the candle with the oil from the middle outward\r\nto the ends.<BR>\r\nAs you are doing this you need to be thinking of your desired\r\ngoal.<BR>\r\nThen sit and meditate on your desire after lighting the candles,\r\nthen read your spell<BR>\r\nor chant your appropriate mantra.<BR>\r\nYou don\'t need some elaborate spell with a bunch of big words\r\nor words you don\'t<BR>\r\neven know how to pronounce. You can make your own spells or rituals.<BR>\r\nThink of your desire then make a simple little rhyme that tells\r\nabout your desire in it.<BR>\r\nIt doesn\'t even have to rhyme. This is all about will power, the\r\npower of positive thinking,<BR>\r\nand creative visualization.

There is also a corresponding color,\r\nday, element and<BR>\r\nmoon phase, all in which, not really necessary, but will give\r\nadded enhancement and power<BR>\r\nto the magic desire. All of these elements together will manifest\r\nto one heck of a wish being<BR>\r\nput out there upon the elements. Now a perfect moon or day is\r\nnot a mandatory condition,<BR>\r\nneither are all the rest of the enhancements. Sometimes, just\r\nthe simple act of lighting of a<BR>\r\ncandle will do. For example, the in-laws are on their way over.\r\nIn order for the night to go<BR>\r\nwell and no tensions or worries for the night, light a scented\r\ncandle, perhaps with Jasmine<BR>\r\nor Lavender and a pink or Blue color too. This not only looks\r\nvery warm and inviting, but the<BR>\r\ncandle is sending out your wishes for a stress free night and\r\nthe scent is working to calm<BR>\r\nand ease the tensions in the room at the same time! Your mother-in-law\r\njust may think you<BR>\r\nare okay after all while the whole time you were performing magic!!!!\r\nIn your magic journal<BR>\r\nor on parchment paper list your goal, the intended result, and\r\na chant, prayer or poem for<BR>\r\nyour spell. For example if your goal is true love and a marriage\r\nproposal, your magical<BR>\r\njournal (or parchment paper) may look like this:<BR>\r\nGOAL: TRUE LOVE<BR>\r\nINTENDED RESULT: Happiness, Marriage<BR>\r\nCHANT: TRUE LOVE, FIND ME NOW,<BR>\r\nBRING WITH YOU, HAPPINESS AND MARRIAGE VOW<BR>\r\nThe whole time you are saying this, you will be concentrating\r\non the outcome of the wish<BR>\r\nas you have envisioned it along with the way in which it will\r\nbe fulfilled. Picture yourself with<BR>\r\nyour desired results, happy, in love, married, home, etc. Take\r\na few moments to do this make<BR>\r\nit a complete picture in your mind. Then take your candle (for\r\nthis example a pink one) place<BR>\r\nin an area so it will be undisturbed. (Please use all precautionary\r\nactions in this too.<BR>\r\nRemember safety of yourself and others.) Determine the day of\r\nthe week (Friday for manifesting<BR>\r\nnew love) and determine the MOON (in this example, you will need\r\na WAXING MOON, to bring&quot;.)<BR>\r\nGather all your energy, thoughts, concentration and picture your\r\ndesired results as you light your candle.<BR>\r\nAt this point you have now all the elements of the magic working\r\nfor you.<BR>\r\nThere is the Air, Water, Earth, Fire, Spirit and Will that you\r\nhave just released and sent out.<BR>\r\nStay thinking about this for a few minutes more of uninterrupted\r\nthoughts.<BR>\r\nAt this time, you can see whether your wish has or is having an\r\neffect by the way in which<BR>\r\nthe flame is behaving. Study its movements and the speaking it\r\nis doing.<BR>\r\nRemember to relate it to the situation. If your candle goes out,\r\nit may be telling you to try again<BR>\r\non another night when you can concentrate a little more. Never\r\nrelight the same candle.<BR>\r\nThe same is true if the candle breaks or is broken. Do not use\r\nit again.<BR>\r\nIt is best to just use the one you tried with for other non-magical\r\npurposes and get a new<BR>\r\none to try again. Let the candle burn undisturbed until extinguished.<BR>\r\nAt this time too, take a look and see if the melted wax from the\r\ncandle left you a message.<BR>\r\nSee if you can discern anything from the image the melted wax\r\nleft for you.<BR>\r\nPlease, don\'t be disappointed if you do not see anything remarkable\r\nor even fairly recognizable.<BR>\r\nA further message is not always necessary and will not always\r\nbe there.<BR>\r\nBut when one is, wow!, really neat and fun too! When you are through,\r\nyou can throw the<BR>\r\nremains away or bury them outside in the ground if you are so\r\ninclined.<BR>\r\nIf you have used a &quot;petition card&quot; (the wish written\r\non a piece of paper or actual cards intended<BR>\r\nfor this reason and burned during the wish making), blow the ashes\r\nto the wind in the appropriate<BR>\r\ndirection of your wish while at the same time, thanking the elements\r\nfor taking up your wish and<BR>\r\nfulfilling what you desire most. Your thoughts again, at this\r\ntime are highly tuned and you must<BR>\r\nbe careful in where they are going to fly. Try to ground yourself\r\nand your energies after you<BR>\r\nhave completed the task so that the energies you produced can\r\nbe released to the elements<BR>\r\nin hopes of fulfillment. You will find Candle Magick is a wondrous\r\nand powerful tool.<BR>\r\nThe above is an example only, again the best one is one you make\r\nyourself.<BR>\r\nUse this as a guideline and remember the intention and the sincere\r\nwish is what is important.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1">CANDLE SPELL AGAINST PSYCHIC\r\nATTACK<BR>\r\n--white candle red candle black candle<BR>\r\nImagine a blue ball of energy inside the candles.

It is simple because it employs little ritual\r\nand few ceremonial artifacts.<BR>\r\nThe theatrical props of candle magick can be purchased at any\r\ndepartment store and its<BR>\r\nrituals can be practiced in any sitting room or bedroom.<BR>\r\nMost of us have performed our first act of candle magick by the\r\ntime we are two years old.<BR>\r\nBlowing out the tiny candles on our first birthday cake and making\r\na wish is pure magic.<BR>\r\nThis childhood custom is based on the three magickal principals\r\nof concentration, will power<BR>\r\nand visualization. In simple terms, the child who wants his wish\r\nto come true has to<BR>\r\nconcentrate (blow out the candles), visualize the end result (make\r\na wish) and hope<BR>\r\nthat it will come true (will power).<BR>\r\nThe size and shape of the candles you use is unimportant, although\r\nhighly decorative,<BR>\r\nextra large, or unusually shaped candles will not be suitable\r\nas these may create distractions<BR>\r\nwhen the magician wants to concentrate on the important work in\r\nhand. Most magicians<BR>\r\nprefer to use candles of standard or uniform size if possible.\r\nThose which are sold in different<BR>\r\ncolors for domestic use are ideal.<BR>\r\nThe candles you use for any type of magical use should be virgin,\r\nthat is unused. Under no<BR>\r\ncircumstances use a candle which has already adorned a dinner\r\ntable or been used as a<BR>\r\nbedroom candle or night-light. There is a very good occult reason\r\nfor not using anything but<BR>\r\nvirgin materials in magic. Vibrations picked up by secondhand\r\nmaterials or equipment may<BR>\r\ndisturb your workings and negate their effectiveness.<BR>\r\nSome magicians who are artistically inclined prefer to make their\r\nown candles for ritual and<BR>\r\nmagical use. This is a very practical exercise because not only\r\ndoes it impregnate the candle<BR>\r\nwith your own personal vibrations, but the mere act of making\r\nyour own candle is magically<BR>\r\npotent. Specialist shops sell candle wax and molds together with\r\nwicks, perfumes, and other equipment.<BR>\r\nThe hot wax is heated until liquid and then poured into the mould\r\nthrough which a suitably<BR>\r\nsized wick has already been threaded. The wax is then left to\r\ncool and once is this has occurred<BR>\r\nthe mould is removed , leaving a perfectly formed candle. Special\r\noil-soluble dyes and perfumes<BR>\r\ncan be added to the wax before the cooling process is complete\r\nto provide suitable colors and<BR>\r\nscents for a particular magical ritual. Craft shops which sell\r\ncandlemaking supplies can also provide<BR>\r\ndo-it-yourself books explaining the technicalities of the art\r\nto the beginner<BR>\r\nOnce you have purchased or made your ritual candle it has to be\r\noiled or \'dressed\' before burning.<BR>\r\nThe purpose of dressing the candle is to establish a psychic link\r\nbetween it and the magician<BR>\r\nthrough a primal sensory experience. By physically touching the\r\ncandle during the dressing<BR>\r\nprocedure, you are charging it with our own personal vibrations\r\nand also concentrating the<BR>\r\ndesire of your magical act into the wax. The candle is becoming\r\nan extension of the magician\'s<BR>\r\nmental power and life energy.<BR>\r\nWhen you dress a candle for magical use, imagine that it is a\r\npsychic magnet with a North and<BR>\r\na South pole. Rub the oil into the candle beginning at the top\r\nor North end and work downwards<BR>\r\nto the half-way point. Always brush in the same direction downwards.\r\nThis process is then<BR>\r\nrepeated by beginning at the bottom or south end and working up\r\nto the middle.<BR>\r\nThe best type of oils to use for dressing candles are natural\r\nones which can be obtained quite easily.<BR>\r\nSome occult suppliers will provide candle magic oils with exotic\r\nnames. If the magician does not<BR>\r\nwant to use these, he can select suitable oils or perfumes from\r\nhis own sources. The oils soluble<BR>\r\nperfumes sold by craft shops for inclusion in candles can be recommended.<BR>\r\nthe candles you use can be colored in accordance with the following\r\nmagical uses:<BR>\r\nwhite- spirituality and peace. red- health, energy, strength,\r\ncourage, sexual potency.<BR>\r\npink- love affection and romance. yellow- intellectualism, imagination,\r\nmemory and creativity<BR>\r\ngreen- fertility, abundance, good luck and harmony blue-inspiration,\r\noccult wisdom, protection<BR>\r\nand devotion purple Material wealth, higher psychic ability, spiritual\r\npower and idealism<BR>\r\nsilver- clairvoyance, inspiration, astral energy and intuition\r\norange- ambition. career matters and the law.<BR>\r\nIf you wanted to use candle magic for healing, you would select\r\na red candle to burn.<BR>\r\nTo pass an exam, burn a yellow candle, to gain esoteric knowledge\r\nburn a blue candle or for<BR>\r\nmaterial gain, burn a purple one. It is obvious these colors relate\r\nto the signs of the zodiac<BR>\r\nand the planetary forces.<BR>\r\nThe simples form of candle magic is to write doesn\'t the objective\r\nof your ritual on a virgin<BR>\r\npiece of paper. You can use color paper which matches the candle.\r\nWrite your petition on<BR>\r\nthe paper using a magical alphabet, such as theban, Enochian,\r\nmalachain, etc. As you write<BR>\r\ndown what you want to accomplish through candle magic-- a new\r\njob, healing for a friend,<BR>\r\na change of residence, a new love affair, etc.-- visualize your\r\ndream coming true.<BR>\r\nVisualize the circumstances under which you might be offered a\r\nnew job, imagine your<BR>\r\nemployer telling you that your salary has been increased or conjure\r\nup a vision of your<BR>\r\nperfect love partner.<BR>\r\nWhen you have completed writing down your petitio, carefully fold\r\nup the paper in a deliberately<BR>\r\nslow fashion. Place the end of the folded paper in the candle\r\nflame and set light to it. As you do<BR>\r\nthis concentrate once more on what you want from life.<BR>\r\nWhen you have completed your ritual, allow the candle to have\r\ncompletely burned away.<BR>\r\nYou do not need to stay with the candle after the ritual, but\r\nmake sure that is safe and that<BR>\r\nred-hot wax will not cause damage or fire. Never re-use a candle\r\nwhich has been lit in any<BR>\r\nmagical ritual. IT should only be used in that ritual and then\r\nallowed to burn away or be<BR>\r\ndisposed of afterwards.<BR>\r\nIf you are conducting a magical ritual which involves two people\r\n(e.g. an absent healing for<BR>\r\na person some distance away) then the second person can be symbolically\r\nrepresented<BR>\r\nduring the ritual by another candle. /all you need to do is find\r\nout the subject\'s birth date<BR>\r\nand burn the appropriate candle for that zodiacal sign.

Turn clockwise in the procession...light\r\na white candle... <BR>\r\nand burn sweet smelling incense. <BR>\r\nWalk around the dwelling and say: <BR>\r\n&quot;We invoke to this place protection, prosperity, peace, healing,\r\nwellness, and creativity.&quot; <BR>\r\nPlace a flower or crystal at each corner of the dwelling. <BR>\r\nNow the procession re-enters the dwelling, and again walking clockwise<BR>\r\nin each room with the white candle and sweet incense repeats the<BR>\r\nabove verse. If you have a flower or crystal to leave in each\r\nroom as <BR>\r\nyou exit, do so. The group forms a circle around the table where\r\nyou <BR>\r\nfirst began. One person (the one in charge) leads the group. She<BR>\r\ntakes the dish of salt, and moving clockwise, leads the group<BR>\r\nthroughout each room saying: <BR>\r\n&quot;By the powers of Earth, I cleanse this dwelling.&quot; <BR>\r\nThe group is to follow her and repeat what she says. <BR>\r\nMake sure to do all the corners, windows, doorways of each room\r\nas <BR>\r\nyou go. Imagine, seeing the salt burning away negativity as you<BR>\r\nsprinkle and toss it. Your purification will be as strong as your\r\nvisualization. <BR>\r\nNext, set the salt down and pick up the censor or incense, carry\r\nit <BR>\r\nfrom room to room (The same route you used with the salt...walking<BR>\r\nclockwise...group following and repeating) Be sure to hold it\r\nbefore <BR>\r\nall windows and doors, and in the corners of each room. Visualize\r\nthe <BR>\r\nsmoke clearing away all negativity and evil. Say the following:<BR>\r\n&quot;By the powers of Air, I cleanse this place.&quot; <BR>\r\nOnce you have walked through the whole dwelling, return the censor\r\nor <BR>\r\nincense to the table. Take the lit white candle on the same route.<BR>\r\nAgain, visualize moving clockwise and holding the flame before<BR>\r\nwindows and doors, seeing it shining forth with magical power,<BR>\r\nburning away negativity. As you go say: <BR>\r\n&quot;By the powers of Fire, I cleanse this place.&quot; <BR>\r\nReplace the candle on the tale and take up the bowl of holy water.<BR>\r\nSprinkle the holy water throughout the house, in every corner,\r\nand at <BR>\r\nexits and entrances. Toss some drops at and through windows. See\r\nand <BR>\r\nknow that the holy water is washing away ills with a tidal wave\r\nof <BR>\r\nmagical power. Say the following: <BR>\r\n&quot;By the powers of Water, I cleanse this place.&quot; <BR>\r\nSet the bowl of holy water on the table. Stand for a few moments\r\nand <BR>\r\nfeel the difference in the dwelling. It should feel calmer, more<BR>\r\npeaceful, fresh and clean. If not, repeat the ritual Group again<BR>\r\nforms a circle around the table. You will need four candles to<BR>\r\nrepresent the four elements/directions, yellow for East/Air, Red\r\nfor <BR>\r\nthe South/Fire, Blue for the West/Water, Green for the North/Earth.<BR>\r\nAlso, if you wish you may use a white candle to represent the\r\nHoly Spirit. <BR>\r\nEach member is to say a prayer, asking for the blessings of the<BR>\r\nGoddess and God, asking for the qualities they want for the dwelling.<BR>\r\nThe leader of the group will light each candle as she says: &quot;I\r\ncall <BR>\r\nupon you, powers of the Air, to witness this rite and to guard\r\nthis <BR>\r\nplace.&quot; (light the yellow candle) &quot;I call upon the Powers\r\nof Fire, to <BR>\r\nwitness this rite and to guard this place.&quot; (Light the red\r\ncandle) &quot;I <BR>\r\ncall upon the Powers of Water, to witness this rite and to guard\r\nthis <BR>\r\nplace.&quot; (Light the blue candle) &quot;I call upon the powers\r\nof Earth to <BR>\r\nwitness this rite and guard this place.&quot; (light the green\r\ncandle) <BR>\r\n&quot;I call upon the Powers of the Holy Spirit to witness this\r\nrite and <BR>\r\nto guard this place.&quot; (Light the white candle) <BR>\r\nLeader says: &quot;Today we dedicate this place to the God and\r\nGoddess, <BR>\r\nfor our protection, safety, peace and creativity. In this ritual\r\nwe <BR>\r\nhave banished anything that could be negative and have invited<BR>\r\ninstead all prosperity and love.&quot; <BR>\r\n&quot;We have invited Earth, who protects all women, children\r\nand the <BR>\r\ndwelling. We have invited Fire who protects the dwelling, home\r\nand <BR>\r\nhearth. We have invited water, who gives abundance. We have invited<BR>\r\nSpirit, who is of the deities and the Earth and who protects all\r\npeoples.&quot; <BR>\r\nYou may want to add blessings, poems, or chants to be done by\r\nmembers of the group.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">PURIFICATION OF SELF SPELL<BR>\r\nThe purification of self is a way to remove the accumulation of\r\nall negative things that <BR>\r\nhappened during the day and to prepare for the work to come. Before\r\nritual work, you have <BR>\r\nto change your frame of mind from the everyday mundane world.\r\n<BR>\r\nHere are a couple of ways to do this.<BR>\r\nIncense: <BR>\r\nYou may use incense in the common stick form or in what is called\r\na smudge stick. <BR>\r\nThis is a small bundle of incense. The incense is lit and is passed\r\naround the body, but not <BR>\r\ntoo close to the hair (fire hazard). As you pass the incense around\r\nyour body, concentrate <BR>\r\non the smoke passing through you. Invision all the negativity\r\nand the excess baggage of <BR>\r\nthe day leaving you as the smoke rises around you. When you feel\r\ncleansed, put out the <BR>\r\nincense. You will need a container to put out the smudge stick.\r\nA terra cotta saucer filled <BR>\r\nwith sand is ideal.<BR>\r\nRitual Baths: <BR>\r\nA ritual bath is a great way to shed the day and concentrate on\r\nthe ritual to come.<BR>\r\nSupplies: <BR>\r\n--White candles, for Spirituality and Higher Self, Salt, Herb\r\nor Herbs for Purification, Candle Snuffer.<BR>\r\nRun a bath of very warm water. As the water is running light the\r\nwhite candles. <BR>\r\nUse as many as you wish. <BR>\r\nThree is an appropriate number as it represents the three aspects\r\nof the Goddess. <BR>\r\nAs you light a candle think or recite aloud: &quot;I light this\r\ncandle in truth and peace&quot;. <BR>\r\nRepeat with each candle. <BR>\r\nWhile the water is running, add a small amount of salt into the\r\nwater, then add the herb <BR>\r\nor herbs of your choice. <BR>\r\nStep into the water and slowly sink down into the tub. <BR>\r\nRelax and feel the water covering your body. <BR>\r\nLet the day and all negativity be drawn into the water. <BR>\r\nConcentrate on letting go and moving to the positive. <BR>\r\nWash slowly. Turn the bath into its own ritual. Think or say aloud\r\n: <BR>\r\n&quot; All negativity is flowing out of me into the water. I am\r\npure for the work to come.&quot; <BR>\r\nTake as long as you need. <BR>\r\nWhen you feel you are clear and relaxed step out of the tub and\r\ndrain the water.<BR>\r\nWatch the water flow down the drain. <BR>\r\nEnvision all the negativity and the day behind you flowing down\r\nthe drain with the water. <BR>\r\nDry yourself slowly, deliberately. As you snuff out the candles,\r\nthink or say aloud: <BR>\r\n&quot;I leave this bath in truth and peace.&quot; You are now\r\nready for the ritual to come.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">HOUSE CLEANSING<BR>\r\nIf you can identify the actual spirit, locate the center point\r\nof the house, and standing there <BR>\r\ntake a cup of red wine. After each of the following statements\r\ntake a sip of wine, <BR>\r\nand drain the cup after the last direction.<BR>\r\nFacing east:<BR>\r\nLady of love and power and all blessings, breathe love into this\r\nhouse, fill air with good. <BR>\r\nThrough you, in you, I bless this house.<BR>\r\nFacing south: <BR>\r\nLady of love and living and all blessings, warm this house with\r\ncomfort, make whole its hearth. <BR>\r\nThrough you, in you, I bless this house.<BR>\r\nFacing west: <BR>\r\nLady of tide and time and every blessing, let every hour flow\r\nsweetly in this house.<BR>\r\nThrough you, in you, I bless this house.<BR>\r\nFacing north: <BR>\r\nLady of strength and riches and all blessings, make this house\r\nstrong and filled with earthly good. <BR>\r\nThrough you, in you, I bless this house.<BR>\r\nWalk around the house saying the following in each room (including\r\nattic and cupboards):<BR>\r\nBe comforted. All is well. Now you are blessed. You have life\r\nto nurture and nurture you. <BR>\r\nBe calm. Be easy. Be comforted. You are blessed.<BR>\r\nIf you can identify the spirit, say the following in the room\r\nmost affected:<BR>\r\nIt is time to leave here. All is well. There is nothing here for\r\nyou. You must be gone. <BR>\r\nGo now, go, complete your passing. Go, and with our blessing and\r\nfarewell.<BR>\r\nOften commanding any evil spirits to leave at once, in the name\r\nof your deity three times works well. <BR>\r\nAfter this you could get a smudge stick of sage, or sage incense,\r\nand perform a house blessing <BR>\r\ncarrying it deosil around the property and from room to room,\r\npaying special attention to doorways, <BR>\r\ncrevices and windows, and also any places that `feel` cold. <BR>\r\nAs you do this with words from a house blessing, scatter salt\r\nand water which has been <BR>\r\nconsecrated and blessed. Have windows and doors open as you bless\r\nthe house. <BR>\r\nSalt scattered along windowsills and doorways will prevent any\r\nentity re-entering the property.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">BANISHING NEGATIVITY<BR>\r\nA Ritual for the Dark Moon<BR>\r\nBegin by setting up your altar as you normally do for ritual,\r\nmaking sure you have a black candle <BR>\r\nand wine or water in your chalice in addition to anything else\r\nyou use. You will also need a cleansing, <BR>\r\npurifying incense and a censer or some kind of container which\r\ncan be carried around your home.<BR>\r\nIt is best to set your altar on the floor for this rite, but you\r\nmay do it however you feel most comfortable.<BR>\r\nCast your circle as you normally do. When you are through, kneel\r\nbefore your altar and light the black <BR>\r\ncandle. With your arms held, palms upward, at your sides, call\r\nHecate by saying three times:<BR>\r\n&quot;Hecate, beautiful Crone of Night <BR>\r\nI call you here to put things right. <BR>\r\nTransform the negative thought and pain <BR>\r\nAnd help my life be whole again.&quot;<BR>\r\nClose your eyes. When you feel the presence of Hecate and know\r\nshe is there to help you, open <BR>\r\nyour eyes. Bow your head to her to show your reverence, and then\r\ntake the chalice, saying:<BR>\r\n&quot;Lady of the Dark Moon, Share with me this wine. <BR>\r\nBring your protection to Flood this life of mine. <BR>\r\nMay the waters of your eternal womb Bring change most divine.&quot;<BR>\r\nSip a small amount of the wine (or water), envisioning it as liquid\r\nenergy, flowing to effect a <BR>\r\npositive change within and outside of you. Leave the rest as an\r\noffering to Hecate. <BR>\r\nLight the purifying incense in the censer, cut a door in the Circle,\r\nand, beginning in the <BR>\r\neastern-most corner of your home, smudge your home, going clockwise.<BR>\r\nGo into every closet, the bathroom, and the garage - make sure\r\nyour entire house is <BR>\r\nsmudged. As you go, chant:<BR>\r\n&quot;Negativity be gone.&quot;<BR>\r\nCome back into the Circle and visualize your entire house and\r\nyard bathed in a peaceful blue light. <BR>\r\nSince you have created a void by banishing the negativity, you\r\nwill need to fill that void. <BR>\r\nAsk that good, protective spirits come into your home and that\r\npositive energies replace the <BR>\r\nnegative ones that have just been banished. This is an important\r\nstep, because if you don\'t <BR>\r\nfill the void with something good, the negativity will come right\r\nback. <BR>\r\nSometimes during such a ritual, I take one large and one small\r\nblack stone and charge <BR>\r\nthem to keep away negativity. I promise Hecate that the large\r\none will remain in a prominent <BR>\r\nplace in my house and that I will keep the small one with me at\r\nall times. Thank Hecate. <BR>\r\nMeditate if you wish, visualizing your life free from negative\r\nhappenings and feelings and <BR>\r\nfull of love, prosperity, and happiness. Feel how She has changed\r\nyour home and your life. <BR>\r\nClose the Circle and know that it is done.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">TO BANISH NEGATIVE FORMS FROM YOUR HOME AND\r\nYOURSELF<BR>\r\nBegin with a purification bath. <BR>\r\nLight the twin candles on the altar and burn a protective and/or\r\ncleansing incense. <BR>\r\nFill your chalice with freshwater (be sure to consecrate it) and\r\nblessed salt. <BR>\r\nKneel or assume the Goddess position as you say: <BR>\r\n&quot;Naked come I into this sanctuary With love and faith <BR>\r\nFrom those who have gone before. Innocent am I in understanding\r\n<BR>\r\nHoly and pure in my love of all good and blessed things. <BR>\r\nSupreme Goddess, ruler of light, Lord of all Hear my prayer, <BR>\r\nHelp me now to dispel this thing of unholiness This creature of\r\ndarkness, <BR>\r\nWho dooms itself to shame and unhappiness. Save him if it is thy\r\nwill to do so. <BR>\r\nSend him to the light. Mercy is the song I sing; Forgiveness the\r\nword most precious. <BR>\r\nIn thy everlasting grace I say this. In humility I ask this. So\r\nmote it be.&quot; <BR>\r\nTake up the chalice of salt-water, face the east wall, dip your\r\nfingers into the water, <BR>\r\nraise your hand and say: <BR>\r\n&quot;Powers of the East Powers of the daystar rising <BR>\r\nAnd all fresh beginnings I purify you with salt and with water<BR>\r\nFor good vibrations of friendship warmth and love.&quot; <BR>\r\nThen sprinkle some extra water and proceed to the south. Say:<BR>\r\n&quot;Powers of the South Powers of the summer sun <BR>\r\nWhich warms our bodies and our minds <BR>\r\nI purify you with salt and with water <BR>\r\nFor good vibrations of friendship, warmth and love.&quot; <BR>\r\nRepeat in the west:<BR>\r\n&quot;Powers of the West Powers of the purifying and cleansing\r\nwaters <BR>\r\nFrom which all life comes. <BR>\r\nI purify you with salt and with water <BR>\r\nFor good vibrations of friendship, warmth and love.&quot; <BR>\r\nRepeat in the north:<BR>\r\n&quot;Powers of the North Powers of the earth, the ground On which\r\nwe stand. <BR>\r\nI purify you with salt and with water For good vibrations of friendship,\r\nwarmth and love.&quot; <BR>\r\nThen proceed around the room sprinkling water over all the thresholds,\r\nwindows, and <BR>\r\ndoorways and in all corners. REPEAT IN EVERY ROOM. Anoint your\r\n3rd eye Chackra <BR>\r\npoint with the holy water. Then.. Add more incense to the burner,\r\ntake up, and do the <BR>\r\nsame thing, using the same verses substituting &quot;fire and\r\nair&quot; in place of &quot;salt and water.&quot; <BR>\r\nAs before, proceed around the room censing all the thresholds,\r\nwindows, doorways, and in <BR>\r\nall corners. REPEAT IN EVERY ROOM. Take the fire candle (or a\r\ncandle for this purpose) <BR>\r\nand your athame and, starting at the door or entrance, walk slowly\r\nCLOCKWISE through <BR>\r\nthe house, through each room pausing at each door, window, and\r\nmirror and moving the <BR>\r\ncandle across it, also pentagramming each window, doorway, and\r\nmirror with the athame. <BR>\r\nProceed room by room spiraling clockwise. Draw a pentagram in\r\nthe air in the incense smoke. <BR>\r\nAll the while chant the following: <BR>\r\n&quot;By the One Power I hereby consecrate this space To the Goddess\r\nand the God, <BR>\r\nAccording to free will And for the good of all; I hereby release,\r\nIn all time and all space, <BR>\r\nAny negative cause, effect, manifestation, form or essence, <BR>\r\nAny negative event, thought, energy, idea or vibration, And transform\r\nit to <BR>\r\nAnd replace it with Only positive, joyous good In keeping with\r\nthe Universal harmonies <BR>\r\nOf the Goddess and the God. This space is divinely protected This\r\nspace is perfectly safe. <BR>\r\nNothing and no one can enter this space Unless I (or my loved\r\nones) allow them to. <BR>\r\nThis space is sacred Consecrated and dedicated to positive living\r\n<BR>\r\nFor myself and my loved ones And for the work of positive magic.\r\n<BR>\r\nNo harm can come to this space, or anyone in it.&quot; <BR>\r\nAs you draw each pentagram say:<BR>\r\n&quot;Only good can enter here No negatives can enter All harm\r\nis sealed out.&quot; <BR>\r\nWhen you are back at the entry point conclude:<BR>\r\n&quot;Love lives here Health lives here <BR>\r\nAbundance lives here (Name self and loved ones) live here <BR>\r\nWe claim this space for ourselves, for the mutual good <BR>\r\nAnd so mote it be!&quot; <BR>\r\nThank the Lady and the Lord. You will feel light and free of any\r\ndarkness. <BR>\r\nDo this Ritual Spell if you have been in contact with anything\r\nnasty that has frightened you. <BR>\r\nIt is also very good if you have had nightmares.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">7 DAY BANISHMENT OF NEGATIVITY<BR>\r\nThis is a Banishment of negativity spell, but a 7 day candle spell\r\ncan be used for other <BR>\r\nworkings, like prosperity, health, love etc. (on different days\r\nof the week) <BR>\r\nThis should be undertaken on Saturday (Saturn), and if you want\r\nto be more precise, <BR>\r\nthe use Saturn\'s hour. You can either choose 12-1 (from midnight)\r\n7-8 am or (from noon) <BR>\r\n2-3 PM and 8-9 PM. It doesn\'t matter what time you finish, just\r\nstart at the proper time. <BR>\r\nDo this spell during the waning Moon towards the last quarter.\r\nBanishment spells <BR>\r\nare done during the Waning Moon because you want to stifle the\r\nnegativity.<BR>\r\nYou will need:<BR>\r\n1. Two regular white stick alter candles<BR>\r\n2. A glass enclosed candle that will burn for approx. one week.\r\nIf your local occult store <BR>\r\ncarries the reverse candle with black wax on top and white or\r\nred at the bottom, this would <BR>\r\nbe great, otherwise a black, brown, blue or purple is good since\r\nthese are some of Saturn\'s colors.<BR>\r\n3. Banishment or Uncrossing oil - or you can make it by taking\r\nthe herb of rosemary, black <BR>\r\ncoshosh, basil, eucalyptus, Vervain and sage (some or all) and\r\nputting them in some vegetable <BR>\r\nor olive oil and cooking them lightly for 5-10 minutes (don\'t\r\nburn), strain into a bottle or jar.<BR>\r\n4. Salt and water for sprinkling (consecration)<BR>\r\n5. Incense, a good quality<BR>\r\n6. Some parchment paper, but nice stationary will do (approx.\r\n3x3 piece)<BR>\r\nBefore you start your ritual you may want to air out your space\r\nwith sage.<BR>\r\nMake sure you air out the room with open windows and doors so\r\nnegative<BR>\r\nspirits can depart. This is optional, but a good idea. Be bathed\r\nand wear some uncrossing oil. <BR>\r\nWear your ritual clothes or clean garments. Your altar and ritual\r\narea should be tidy but <BR>\r\nhave your personal touch on it, with the things that represent\r\nyou.<BR>\r\nBegin by lighting your incense and sprinkle water and salt in\r\nthe 4 directions, move deosil, <BR>\r\nor clockwise (dispel). Offer a short prayer in your own words\r\nto the elements earth air fire <BR>\r\nand water to come to your space to purify it. You can include\r\nyour favorite wights or protectors.<BR>\r\nMake this as personal as possible. What matters is what \'you\'\r\nidentify with, not trying to <BR>\r\nidentify with some entity you\'ve never heard of. Just be sincere,\r\nand visualize your space <BR>\r\nbeing protected. If you want to draw an imaginary circle moving\r\nclockwise, that\'s fine too, <BR>\r\nas long as you indicate the purification of your working space.<BR>\r\nAfter the consecration, light the two white alter candles (protectors)\r\nand offer an invocation/prayer <BR>\r\nto your main deity and in your own words ask him/her for protection\r\nand the banishment of all <BR>\r\nnegative entities that are troubling you, ask him/her to send\r\nthem back to their origin. <BR>\r\nThey have no place in your life. Ask for all harm to be turned\r\naway from you, leaving<BR>\r\nbehind only prosperity, happiness, courage, acceptance of transitions\r\nwithout doubt and <BR>\r\nfear, and control over your life. <BR>\r\nState that your external forces have no power over you. Again,\r\njust be sincere, and <BR>\r\nwhether you do this in a poem form or just simply state it doesn\'t\r\nmatter, just say it with conviction.<BR>\r\nAfter your invocation, take some banishment oil and &quot;charge&quot;\r\nthe top of your glass encased <BR>\r\ncandle with your finger tips, moving deosil, and offer a few words\r\nto remove and expel all <BR>\r\nthe negativity around you. Now light the candle.<BR>\r\nThe parchment paper is your seal. It serves as an amulet, talisman\r\nand charm, it will do the <BR>\r\nwork for you. There are many kinds of seals, but it can simply\r\nbe something you create. <BR>\r\nWrite your intent or wish on the paper, in this case the banishment\r\nof ill-forces and your <BR>\r\nprotection. Then put a few dabs of banishment oil on it and put\r\nit under your candle and <BR>\r\nleave it there until it burns out.<BR>\r\nWhen you\'ve finished with your seal, thank your deity and helpful\r\nspirits and ask them to <BR>\r\ndepart and do your bidding.<BR>\r\nClose the ritual by extinguishing your two main alter candles\r\n(never blow on the fire element). <BR>\r\nYour 7 day candle will stay lit until it burns out, so you may\r\nwant to have it in an extra glass <BR>\r\nor metal bowl for safety\'s sake, and out of reach for anyone to\r\ntouch (including Freyja).<BR>\r\nThis is the end of you ritual. Now evening until the candle burns\r\nout, pick a certain time <BR>\r\nand stick to it, to sit down with your candle anywhere from 15\r\n-30 minutes and seriously <BR>\r\nand intently focus or meditate on your wish or expectation. It\'s\r\nalways good to start with <BR>\r\na prayer or chant, this depends on you particular spiritual practice\r\nand whatever suits you. <BR>\r\nNever miss a single day. If more than one of you is doing this\r\nritual, you must all sit together <BR>\r\neach evening for the candle visualization and stick to it.<BR>\r\nWhen the candle finally burns out (7 days, sooner or later), take\r\nthe seal and burn it, and <BR>\r\nsprinkle the ashes outside your front door and forget about it.\r\nYou have banished all the ill <BR>\r\nforces around you, go confidently about your daily life.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">9/9/01</FONT>\r\n\r\n</BODY>',

Here\'s a short list of herbs that\r\nseem to be tailor-made for each of the <BR>\r\nsigns, due to their associations with both the planetary ruler\r\nand the positive qualities of that sign.<BR>\r\nAries - Mars<BR>\r\nAllspice, basil, cayenne, garlic, ginger, mustard, onion, pepper.<BR>\r\nIt\'s no secret that Aries is the astrological equivalent of a\r\nbullet.<BR>\r\nIt\'s a red-hot burst of energy that\'s capable of overcoming any<BR>\r\nobstacle by charging straight for it. The ruler of Aries is Mars,\r\nthe &quot;red&quot;<BR>\r\nplanet, the ancient god of war who was known for his equally fiery<BR>\r\ntemperament. No wonder, then, the herbs that correspond with your\r\nsign<BR>\r\nare also a bit &quot;hot&quot; to the taste. Use them in cooking\r\nto raise your<BR>\r\nendorphins, the substance Mars loves best.<BR>\r\nTaurus - Venus<BR>\r\nApple, apricot, blackberry, cherry, heather, hibiscus, raspberry,\r\nrose. <BR>\r\nTaurus is the sign that\'s fondest of the pleasures that life inside<BR>\r\nthese bodies can provide. Whether it\'s a blazing sunset, a symphony\r\nby<BR>\r\nMozart, or a delicious meal, you folks are experts at enjoying\r\nthe<BR>\r\nphysical delights of the senses. It\'s no surprise that the herbs\r\nyou\'ll<BR>\r\nenjoy most are the sweet ones, since your planet, Venus, is the<BR>\r\npurveyor of sweetness. Use each of them to satisfy that sweet\r\ntooth.<BR>\r\nGemini - Mercury<BR>\r\nClover, eyebright, fennel, lemongrass, lemon verbena, marjoram,\r\nparsley. <BR>\r\nYour quick-witted, fleet-footed energy just loves variety - in\r\nfact, the<BR>\r\nexpression &quot;variety is the spice of life&quot; was written\r\nwith you in mind.<BR>\r\nEach of these herbs provide a different type of taste, and most\r\ncan be<BR>\r\ncombined in a light, aromatic tea you can sip on the run. Use\r\nclove or<BR>\r\nslippery elm to protect against gossip and to keep your thoughts\r\nand<BR>\r\nactions grounded.<BR>\r\nCancer - Moon<BR>\r\nAloe, lemon balm, chamomile, mimosa, lavender, lilac.<BR>\r\nNurturing is your business, Cancer, and you distribute your soothing<BR>\r\ntouch to one and all. There\'s nothing you like better than a home\r\nthat<BR>\r\nsmells good, too, whether it\'s because there\'s something wonderful<BR>\r\nsimmering on the stove, a vase of fresh flowers on the dining\r\nroom<BR>\r\ntable, or a warm, fragrant bubble bath waiting for you upstairs.\r\nEach <BR>\r\nof the herbs listed above are known for their ability to calm,\r\nheal, or<BR>\r\nbring a wonderful aroma to the environment. Use aloe to soothe\r\nburns <BR>\r\nand scrapes and chamomile for a wonderful bedtime tea.<BR>\r\nLeo - Sun<BR>\r\nChicory, cinnamon, goldenseal, rosemary, St. John\'s Wort, sandalwood.<BR>\r\nYour planet is the Sun, Leo, the source of life and warmth that\r\nkeeps <BR>\r\nus all alive and provides us with the energy we need to keep pursuing\r\nour<BR>\r\nlife\'s quest. It makes perfect sense, then, that the bright, cheerful<BR>\r\nsunflower would be the perfect representation of your equally\r\nbright <BR>\r\nand happy sign. Herbs like goldenseal and St. John\'s Wort are\r\ntailor-made<BR>\r\nfor you, too, since their ability to keep the body resistant to\r\nillness<BR>\r\nand depression are well known. Mix a bit of chicory with your\r\nmorning<BR>\r\ncoffee to help remove any obstacles that come up.<BR>\r\nVirgo - Mercury <BR>\r\nCaraway, dill, eyebright, horehound, lily of the valley, marjoram,\r\nsavory.<BR>\r\nYour quick-thinking meticulous sign likes nothing better than\r\na mental<BR>\r\nchallenge, Virgo, whether it\'s organizing a pile of papers at\r\nthe<BR>\r\noffice, solving a puzzle, or learning a new skill.

The influence of your\r\nplanet,<BR>\r\nSaturn, gives you the ambition and self-discipline to attain those<BR>\r\ngoals, and to ensure success and prosperity in business matters,\r\ntoo.<BR>\r\nEach of the herbs mentioned above are known for their ability\r\nto attract<BR>\r\nthat success, and most can be mixed together in a tea.<BR>\r\nAquarius - Uranus/Saturn<BR>\r\nAnise, bittersweet, citron, dandelion, lemon verbena, rosemary,\r\nsage. <BR>\r\nYour sign is a cerebral one, Aquarius, and your ability to turn\r\n&quot;odd&quot; or<BR>\r\neccentric ideas into strokes of genius is well known. Since<BR>\r\ncommunication (and mass communication in particular) is your specialty,<BR>\r\nthe herbs above are all associated with the air principle, which\r\nrules<BR>\r\nthe intellectual side of life.

Since\r\nit is a <BR>\r\nprojective metal it is used today for defensive magick to deflect\r\nnegative <BR>\r\nenergies away. Steel knives are used either through visualization\r\nor <BR>\r\nphysically held while visualizing negative impulses and all negative\r\nenergies <BR>\r\naway from yourself. Afterwards take the knife and place it under\r\nyour <BR>\r\nmattress to symbolically serve as protection and to block negative\r\nenergies <BR>\r\nfrom disturbing your thoughts at night.

When the candle is completely spent,\r\nrepeat the original spell<BR>\r\nwith a new white candle.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">A LOOK AT LUCID DREAMING AND OUT OF BODY EXPERIENCES<BR>\r\nthe most important piece of factual information is, You are doing\r\nthis naturally anyway,<BR>\r\nso all you have to do is become AWARE that you are doing it. Awareness\r\nhas always<BR>\r\nbeen the keys to the doors of perception. And a induced OOBE where\r\nyou are fully<BR>\r\nconscious is just taking your physical consciousness, your logical\r\nleft brain functions<BR>\r\nalong for the ride.<BR>\r\nThe left brain is vital to memory and recording this experience,\r\nalso when the left brain<BR>\r\nand right brain are working, you become aware, that part of you\r\nthat you associate yourself<BR>\r\nwith that say\'s, &quot;I think therefore I am.&quot;<BR>\r\nSo I guess the key for successful anything in the dream state\r\nor OOBE is knowing you do it<BR>\r\nanyway in deep sleep, and all you have to do is join in on the\r\nadventure with your conscious<BR>\r\nawareness. The rest will fall into place. Since we are just going\r\nto flick a switch to activate<BR>\r\nyou in when your physical body sleeps, the key is awareness, and\r\nthe action is mind awake,<BR>\r\nbody asleep.<BR>\r\nThis is achieved without any fancy rituals, no meditating in ashrams,\r\nseeking the great Makullu...<BR>\r\neating special herbs etc...etc... those are focuses that can and\r\ndo distort this experience with<BR>\r\nexpectations and beliefs. The best technique I can offer is the\r\nmost natural one you can think of.<BR>\r\nTo let this experience occur with natural sleeping patterns so\r\nthat you can achieve it as you<BR>\r\nshould naturally. It\'s called the &quot;Lazy Human Release Technique&quot;\r\nYou will begin to pattern<BR>\r\nyour awareness into the dreaming state as we<BR>\r\nspeak...when you sleep at night, all I ask of you to do is just\r\nthis.<BR>\r\nTell yourself:<BR>\r\n&quot;I am going to sleep now. I know I will be dreaming.<BR>\r\nI am going to be aware of what happens when I fall asleep.<BR>\r\nI will remember what I dream in full conscious detail.&quot;<BR>\r\nFall asleep normally, except for the fact that you are going to\r\nlet yourself be conscious<BR>\r\nwhile it happens...if you are finding it difficult to relax and\r\nsleep because you are exerting<BR>\r\nto much alert mental control, let go and relax...play around with\r\nthinking in sounds and images<BR>\r\nrather than words...speak the language of the right brain. Occupy\r\nas much of your left brain<BR>\r\nwith your own sleep inducing techniques so that it follows a natural\r\npattern to sleep as well.<BR>\r\nInstead of dreaming naturally you are controlling your dream just\r\nlike you do when you breath...<BR>\r\nit happens naturally, but you can control it when you desire.\r\nSometimes you\'ll have to just let<BR>\r\ngo and fall asleep hoping that you have triggered enough interest\r\nin yourself to pop awake<BR>\r\nnaturally. If this is not working so smoothly, we can try to formulate\r\nmore mental techniques<BR>\r\nto induce this state, but in the end, it all comes down to falling\r\nasleep naturally, but just being<BR>\r\naware in those states.<BR>\r\nTake the Monroe Institutes example. They use HEMI-SYNC, and follow\r\na series of conditions<BR>\r\nthat help, but this is again, a focus technique to do something\r\nthat occurs naturally.<BR>\r\nAnd it does not require HEMI- SYNC to do this, but apparently\r\nHEMI-SYNC helps...<BR>\r\nI always think that it\'s a placebo(sp) effect...but if it works,\r\ngreat. And it does.<BR>\r\nWe\'ll create a similar pattern but with using suggestion. While\r\ngoing back to sleep...<BR>\r\nIf you are thinking to much and have too much on your mind, drop\r\nthe excess baggage, it<BR>\r\nwill just get in the way. Here\'s a great technique using visualization\r\nto release your fears,<BR>\r\nanxieties, and concerns as well as anything else blocking your\r\nexperiment.<BR>\r\nVisualize a bright white balloon glowing vibrantly with white\r\nlight. Place the anxieties, concerns,<BR>\r\nfears, and anything else interfering with your experiment into\r\nthe balloon. Attach a :<BR>\r\nThis won\'t bother me anymore, it wont interfere with my OOBE.\r\nAnd let the balloon float up<BR>\r\nand away from your imaginative sight. Do a deep breathing technique\r\nto help relax you if your<BR>\r\nnot relaxed enough.<BR>\r\nBreath around 10 to 20 deep breaths. As you breath in, visualize\r\nvibrant energy entering from<BR>\r\nall parts of your body, and when you breath out, visualize used\r\nup, tired energy pouring out from<BR>\r\nevery part of you and relax. Say an affirmation:<BR>\r\nI use a blend of the Monroe, and my own...you can review both\r\nand add to it like you would a<BR>\r\nsignature according to the desired experience you wanted.<BR>\r\n&quot; I will be fully conscious as I am now when my Body falls\r\nasleep. I will be fully alert and will<BR>\r\nremember in full conscious detail what I am experiencing. I desire\r\nto go out-of-body and explore<BR>\r\nthis state with all my awareness.&quot; That is a great simplified\r\none to program yourself if your not as<BR>\r\nsuccessful with following the natural patterns of sleep into waking\r\nOOBE.<BR>\r\nas you phase between states of consciousness...it is multi-layered\r\nso expect different states of<BR>\r\nawareness to reveal themselves to you. I call one state Secondary\r\nConsciousness where<BR>\r\nSUPER-IMPOSED REALSIM kicks in and you think you are awake. So\r\nyou get up, eat breakfast<BR>\r\nand fret about not going OOB. Then you wake up. That\'s a good\r\nexample of your mental ability to<BR>\r\nproject a reality. There is more to it though.<BR>\r\nWhat To Expect When Your Out Of Body<BR>\r\nThe initial first times may be very limited to just confirming\r\nthat you are OOB by checking your<BR>\r\nphysical body out. It is a great time to explore the physical\r\nsurroundings by touching a wall, passing<BR>\r\nyour hand into it, feel your physical body and put your non-physical\r\nhand in it. Check out your<BR>\r\nnon-physical body and LEARN LEARN LEARN all you can, Record the\r\ninformation when you<BR>\r\nwake up. You may feel a strong pull like a magnet pulling you\r\nback towards your body, you can<BR>\r\nresist by focusing on an object, grab it and confirm that you\r\nare going to remain conscious.<BR>\r\nYou may be limited to just five or ten feet...(self imposed limitations)\r\nYou may phase into other<BR>\r\nareas of the human space/time areas of experience and view 3-D\r\nsensory locations where it\'s<BR>\r\naccumulation of human thoughts and emotions...I highly recommend\r\nknowing that this area is<BR>\r\nwhere a lot of HUMAN thinking/fretting/believing/screaming/loving/etc\r\nis stored and is best left to<BR>\r\nitself. The ideal goal of your OOBE is not to stay in these thought\r\ncircles, but to rise above them<BR>\r\nto the more intelligent and orderly ones where you can actual\r\nlearn practical information regarding<BR>\r\nyour human experience and the reality you were once so completely\r\nfocused in. Expect to go<BR>\r\nforward and back in time. View locations you have never been to.\r\nGo to other planets and reality<BR>\r\nsystems...it is a very, very big and vast universe...you have\r\nmuch to LEARN LEARN LEARN!<BR>\r\nI suggest visiting friends for the first part, learning to phase\r\ninto the dreaming spheres where we<BR>\r\ngather in groups, there is so much...but never fear or worry about\r\nrevealing truths.<BR>\r\nRemember, you do this anyway, so the best thing to do, is ask\r\nthat part of you that knows the<BR>\r\nterritory to show you around...when OOB, just acknowledge that\r\nthere is a part of you that knows<BR>\r\nthis, and ask it to be your guide, that\'s the best advice I can\r\noffer, who better to show you the<BR>\r\nterritory than your self Expect to turn unknowns into knowns,\r\nand beliefs in to truths as you<BR>\r\nLEARN LEARN LEARN all you can about yourself and your relationship\r\nto this vast universe,<BR>\r\nyou may uncover just how damn important you really are. All will\r\nfall into place.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">THE SCIENCE OF TOTAL RECALL OF YOUR DREAMS<BR>\r\nBelieve it or not you can learn to recall most all your Dreams.<BR>\r\nWith these simple techniques you can start remembering dreams\r\nwithin the first or second<BR>\r\nnight of practice. It\'s sort of like self hypnosis in a way. You\r\nare simply making suggestions<BR>\r\nto your mind before you are completely asleep.<BR>\r\nThis state of mind is called the borderline sleep level. It is\r\nwhen your brain is most likely to<BR>\r\nabsorb the suggestions. They say that certain foods can cause\r\nbad dreams.<BR>\r\nThen again, sometimes when you eat food before bedtime that gives\r\nyou indigestion, it might<BR>\r\nseem that it is causing you to have dreams. This is do to the\r\nfact that the indigestion is keeping<BR>\r\nyou slightly awake. You know that borderline sleep level I mentioned\r\nearlier, so you are slightly<BR>\r\naware of these dreams. There is one other thing to consider. If\r\nyou are having intense dreams<BR>\r\nand they are in color then more than likely you are having a OBE.<BR>\r\nThere are 4 easy steps to this.<BR>\r\n1. Preparing for Bed :Try to get the body as relaxed as you can.<BR>\r\nIf you have to stretch or even do Yoga all the better.<BR>\r\nYou can even meditate to clear your mind, so that you are more\r\nprepared for the next step.<BR>\r\nYou don\'t have to eat or refrain from eating before bedtime. You\r\nmay do as you like.<BR>\r\nTry experimenting with eating different foods before bedtime and\r\nsee if you get any different<BR>\r\nresults in the end. Make sure you have a pen and pad handy to\r\nwrite with next to the bed.<BR>\r\n2. Programming : This is the most important part. When you get\r\nto that borderline sleep level<BR>\r\n(which is right before you are completely asleep) you must tell\r\nyourself over and over again<BR>\r\nthat you will remember all your dreams and you will wake up after\r\neach dream and write down<BR>\r\nyour experience. If you don\'t like having to repeat all that then\r\ntry tape recording yourself saying<BR>\r\nthese things. Make sure that you tape at least 10 - 15 min. worth.\r\nThat should be sufficient.<BR>\r\n3. Taking Notes :This is also very important. If you successfully\r\nwake up after each dream,<BR>\r\nthen you must write down everything you can remember in detail.\r\nWrite down whether the dream<BR>\r\nwas in color or black and white. This is why we will keep a pen\r\nand pad next the bed. Make sure<BR>\r\nnot to put it in the bed with you. You don\'t want to end up stabbing\r\nyourself in your sleep.<BR>\r\nThen you must try to go right back to sleep.<BR>\r\nKeeping the pen and pad handy. Hopefully you will go right into\r\nanother dream and repeat the process.<BR>\r\n4. Reviewing the Night :Now it is time to review the night. You\r\nwill be amazed at how many dreams<BR>\r\nyou actually had that night! I usually find that I have 10 - 15\r\ndreams a night and sometimes more.<BR>\r\nEveryone dreams and everyone dreams many times a night, they just\r\ndon\'t know they do until they<BR>\r\ntry something like this. Make special note of dreams that are\r\nin full-blown color, for you will want to<BR>\r\nreference them once you start studying Astral Projection.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">ASTRAL TRAVEL<BR>\r\nAstral Projection, out of body experience, lucid dreaming<BR>\r\nDon\'t you want to know what the other side will be like?<BR>\r\nWe all leave our physical bodies when we go to sleep at night.<BR>\r\nYou may have thought you were dreaming when actually you out of\r\nbody traveling around the astral planes.<BR>\r\nFor instance if you were dreaming in full blown color and maybe\r\nflying or falling.<BR>\r\nIn these scenarios you would be actually be astral projecting.<BR>\r\nYou can learn to consciously leave the body by using my porthole\r\ndevice or<BR>\r\nyou can use my dream control method, or maybe this method here.<BR>\r\nJust so you know... there are many different methods to induce\r\nan out of body experience.<BR>\r\nThere is no best method. The best method is whatever works best\r\nfor you.<BR>\r\nHere is one simple method that is easy to learn.<BR>\r\nSimply lay down with the lights off. Make sure you are completely\r\nrelaxed.<BR>\r\nLie there and be quite and still, calm and clear your mind.<BR>\r\nImagine your astral body which may look like gray matter shaped\r\nin the form of your body.<BR>\r\nImagine it lifting and floating out of your body, floating up\r\nto the ceiling in your room.<BR>\r\nTurn and look down and try to see you body lying there.<BR>\r\nIf you are successful you may want to stay in the room and float\r\naround a bit,<BR>\r\nstaying close to the body. Or you can choose to walk through walls\r\nand travel to<BR>\r\nwhere ever you wish to go. You can fly there or you can will yourself\r\nthere instantly.<BR>\r\nHere are some pointers:<BR>\r\nWatch what you think. Everything you think can manifest on the\r\nastral planes.<BR>\r\nSo you don\'t want to be thinking about anything evil or you will\r\nattract it!<BR>\r\nAnytime you think you are scared and or lost, just think of your\r\nbody and you will be back in it in a flash.<BR>\r\nEver notice that when you are falling in a dream and you hit the\r\nbottom you always wake up quickly!<BR>\r\nThat is your astral body snapping back into place.<BR>\r\nThe use of drugs can lower your vibrations meaning you will not\r\nbe able to travel to<BR>\r\nhigher astral planes where the vibrations are higher.<BR>\r\nThe reason you will want to travel higher on the astral planes\r\nis because you may have<BR>\r\nto escape an attack by a lower vibrating entity. They can not\r\ntravel to the higher planes.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">DREAM CONTROL METHOD<BR>\r\nLearn to realize you are having an out of body experience through\r\ndream control!<BR>\r\nThen when you have become successful with that part of dream control\r\n, you will be ready<BR>\r\nfor this part. You need to advance your dream techniques to where\r\nyou realize that you<BR>\r\nare dreaming so that you can control the dream. Once you realize\r\nthat you are dreaming<BR>\r\nyou will find that you can control where you want to go and what\r\nyou want to do.<BR>\r\nNow I am talking about when you have a dream that is in full blown\r\ncolor.<BR>\r\nThose type of dreams usually mean that your are actually out of\r\nbody. You see, when people<BR>\r\ngo to sleep at night their astral bodies leave and float around\r\nthe astral planes in a dreamy<BR>\r\nstate or gathering energy. Sometimes you may be learning things\r\nfrom other higher beings<BR>\r\nand eventually it is released in your conscious state later on\r\nwhen these beings think the<BR>\r\ntime is right. You just have to become conscious of all this.<BR>\r\nHere are your key pointers:<BR>\r\nWork with dreams that are in full color.<BR>\r\nYou must learn to become conscious during the dream.<BR>\r\nTry to take control of the dream and go where you wish.<BR>\r\nWhen you have achieved control you will know you have had an OBE!<BR>\r\nRemember to keep a diary of every experience.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">What is Lucid Dreaming?<BR>\r\nLucid Dreaming is knowing that you are dreaming while you are\r\ndoing it.<BR>\r\nWhen you know that you are dreaming, you can also alter the dream\r\ncourse.<BR>\r\nAnd with practice you can also develop full control over your\r\ndream, you will be able to create<BR>\r\nand change the environment and change your own appearance. It\r\nwill be you that are in control<BR>\r\nof the dream scenario. You can do whatever you want to do. Live\r\nout your wildest fantasy, or just<BR>\r\nsit down and chit chat with someone. You should also be open for\r\nthe possibility to share dreams<BR>\r\nand travel in time and space when you develop adequate control\r\nover your dreams.<BR>\r\nThe word Lucid means that you have a clear and full consciousness.<BR>\r\nLucid Dreaming can be much more fun than waking reality.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">In what stage of sleep does Lucid Dreaming\r\noccur?<BR>\r\nLucid Dreaming usually takes place in REM (Rapid Eye Movement)\r\nsleep.<BR>\r\nThere are five stages of sleep. Stage 1 being the one you first\r\nenter, then followed by stage 2, 3 and 4.<BR>\r\nAs you descend into deeper sleep your brain frequency slows down.\r\nIn stage 4 can it be slower than<BR>\r\none cycle per second (delta sleep). After some time spent in stage\r\n4, about 25 minutes, you return to<BR>\r\nstage 3 and 2, then straight into REM sleep. About 90 minutes\r\nhas passed now since you started sleeping.<BR>\r\n5-10 minutes is spent in this stage before you go all the way\r\ndown to stage 4 again (also called non-REM sleep).<BR>\r\nWhen approximately 90 minutes have again passed, another REM-period\r\nstart.<BR>\r\nThis time the REM sleep lasts longer. And as time progresses less\r\ntime in non-REM sleep is needed and<BR>\r\nmore time is spent in REM sleep. After 4-5 hours you don\'t go\r\nlower than stage 2. Vivid dreaming takes<BR>\r\nplace in REM sleep, so the more you sleep, the more time is spent\r\nin REM and the more likely it is that<BR>\r\nyou may have a Lucid Dream.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Does Lucid Dreaming interfere with normal sleep?<BR>\r\nNo. The only difference is that you are aware that you are dreaming.<BR>\r\nUnless you have some sort of sleep disorder that causes you to\r\nget less delta sleep, but then<BR>\r\nagain, it\'s not the LD\'s fault. There is no danger with Lucid\r\nDreaming. But if you have a bad<BR>\r\nheart you might have a hearth attack if you crash a car, or during\r\nsexual intercourse.<BR>\r\nOther than that Lucid Dreaming is one of the safest activities.\r\nIt can even be used for healing.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">What purposes can Lucid Dreaming serve?<BR>\r\nThose are so many. First of all, it is lots of fun. You can do\r\nwhatever you feel like, without<BR>\r\nputting yourself in danger, or spending a lot of money on journeys\r\nor expensive equipment. It<BR>\r\nis great for therapy if you have any psychological problems. If\r\nyou have a fear of spiders,<BR>\r\nthat fear can be conquered through Lucid Dreaming. You know you\r\nare totally safe in a Lucid<BR>\r\nDream. So you carefully begin with tiny spiders far away, and\r\nas you get used to them, you<BR>\r\nmight let them go closer and make them bigger. If there is something\r\nyou want to get better at,<BR>\r\nlike Tennis or Snowboarding, then Lucid Dreaming can improve your\r\nskill.<BR>\r\nLucid Dreaming can be extremely powerful for motor skill enhancement.<BR>\r\nThis is not only true because of the vividness of the imagery,\r\nbut also because the<BR>\r\nphysiological nature of REM sleep is ideal for establishing neural\r\npattern without actual movement.<BR>\r\nExperiments also show that you can get physically stronger with\r\nmental training.<BR>\r\nLucid Dreaming can be used for healing if you have any illness.<BR>\r\nIf you wish to have your subconscious read at a rate of 1 million\r\nwords per minute, you can<BR>\r\nactivate that in a Lucid Dream to gain conscious awareness over\r\nthe knowledge.<BR>\r\nYou can meet the author of the book you just read in a Lucid Dream,\r\nand ask questions you are<BR>\r\nseeking answers for in the book. Or you can sit down and watch\r\nthe whole novel on a big screen<BR>\r\nTV with cinema 3D sound. You can use Lucid Dreaming for solving\r\na complex and difficult problem,<BR>\r\nlike mathematical problems. You can share a dream with a friend.\r\nOr even a whole group of people.<BR>\r\nSo you can hang out with your friends when you are sleeping too,\r\nnot only when you are awake.<BR>\r\nIt is also great being a group of people trying to Lucid Dream.\r\nIf you find your friends in a dream,<BR>\r\nyou can tell them that they are dreaming. This way can you help\r\nyour friends gaining Lucidity, and<BR>\r\nthey might cause you to gain Lucidity if they find you. If you\r\nhave full conscious control over<BR>\r\na dream can you also use it to travel in time. You can explore\r\nthe future.<BR>\r\nEven shared precognitive dreaming is possible. With a little practice\r\ncan you also<BR>\r\nuse Lucid Dreaming to leave your body and explore the world. By\r\ndoing this you can also meet<BR>\r\nother spirits and travel in time. More about this can be found\r\nin the Out of Body Experience FAQ.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Can anyone learn Lucid Dreaming?<BR>\r\nYes. Just like everyone dream, virtually anyone can learn to be\r\naware that they are dreaming.<BR>\r\nHow long it takes for you to learn Lucid Dreaming depends on how\r\ngood your dream recall is, how<BR>\r\nmotivated you are and what techniques you are using. And how many\r\nhours you sleep each night.<BR>\r\nHopefully techniques and devices will be developed so that you\r\nmay have your first Lucid Dreaming<BR>\r\nwithin a few nights. A few techniques and devices have already\r\ngiven results in such short time.<BR>\r\nBut there is always room for improvement. In order to Lucid Dream\r\nyou should have good dream recall.<BR>\r\nMany helpful and effective tips for developing dream recall can\r\nbe found in my Dreaming FAQ.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">What should I do once I\'m Lucid?<BR>\r\nAbsolutely nothing at first. You might want to try to find out\r\nhow conscious you are, make sure<BR>\r\nthat the logical part of your brain is functioning and that all\r\nyour senses are working. You<BR>\r\nneed to remember your intent, do some math tasks, recall a few\r\nthings from your life, what time<BR>\r\nit is, what date it is, where you are and stuff like that. Look\r\naround you and observe things.<BR>\r\nDon\'t feel like you are in a hurry and need to get things done\r\nbefore the Dream fades.<BR>\r\nAlso make sure that you are in a dream, not in hypnagogic imagery.\r\nAll your senses should be<BR>\r\nworking including tactile feelings. I want to emphasize that you\r\nmake sure that your logical abilities<BR>\r\nare working. Not only do they create your consciousness, they\r\ncan also create the most splendid<BR>\r\ndreams you could ever imagine. Once you are satisfied with your\r\nlogical abilities you can cut loose<BR>\r\nand start controlling the dream.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Lucid Dreaming techniques</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">How can I have a Lucid Dream?<BR>\r\nDreams are mostly a reflection of your thoughts throughout your\r\nday. Therefore, thinking of<BR>\r\nDreams during the day, asking yourself if you are Dreaming and\r\nwanting to have Lucid Dreams<BR>\r\nwhen you are awake might be helpful. The wishes might reflect\r\nthemselves in your dreams.<BR>\r\nRemaining conscious until you start dreaming is one way. And seeing\r\ncues in your dream that<BR>\r\nreminds you that it is a dream is also helpful. There are also\r\ndrugs and herbs that cause you<BR>\r\nto be more consciously aware, and therefore also increase the\r\npossibility for a Lucid Dream.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Does Reality Testing (RT) work?<BR>\r\nYes. Reality testing is simply asking yourself if you are dreaming.\r\nFinding that out isn\'t<BR>\r\nalways easy in a dream. But usually is it quite obvious if you\r\nare dreaming or not. You may<BR>\r\nfind yourself on an unfamiliar place or doing/seeing something\r\nthat will not likely happen in<BR>\r\nreality. But sometimes can you find yourself in your bed, and\r\neverything looks as it is suppose<BR>\r\nto be. You can try to read something, look away, and see if the\r\nsame text is there the second<BR>\r\ntime you read it. You can try changing colors on something or\r\ntry to fly. If you have a digital<BR>\r\nclock you can try looking at it, looking away and looking at it\r\nagain. If something unusual is<BR>\r\nhappening are you probably dreaming. But every reality test may\r\nfail; if that happens, don\'t<BR>\r\ntry jumping out the window or something else that might harm you.\r\nReality tests should be done<BR>\r\nevery hour throughout the day, or more frequently. And especially\r\nbefore going to sleep and if<BR>\r\nyou wake up in the middle of the night. Waking up after 5-6 hours,\r\ndo some reality tests and go<BR>\r\nto sleep again may help.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">How does the Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams\r\n(MILD) technique work?<BR>\r\nIt works by setting your intention to remember to recognize you\r\nare dreaming. Stephen LaBerge<BR>\r\nfrom the Lucidity Institute developed it while he was trying to\r\nincrease his Lucid Dreams<BR>\r\nfrequency. A good approach is waking up after 5-6 hours, remember\r\na dream and tell yourself:<BR>\r\n&quot;Next time I\'m dreaming, I will remember I\'m dreaming.&quot;\r\nYou need to really mean it. Concentrate<BR>\r\non this thought only, if you find yourself thinking on something\r\nelse, just let the thought go<BR>\r\nand return to your intention. Also try to imagine that you are\r\nback in the dream, but this time<BR>\r\nyou recognize that you are dreaming. Look for unusual things that\r\nsuggest you are dreaming<BR>\r\nand tell yourself: &quot;I must be dreaming!&quot; Do this with\r\nall the unusual things you see from the<BR>\r\ndream you remember. Continue with this until you fall asleep.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">How does the Wake-Initiated Lucid Dream (WILD)\r\ntechnique work?<BR>\r\nIt works by remaining conscious until you start dreaming. The\r\nLucidity Institute also first<BR>\r\npresented this technique, but it is not easy if you don\'t have\r\na clue what to do. But it is<BR>\r\nquite easy and effective if you do it right. Again, you need to\r\nsleep 5-6 hours before trying<BR>\r\nthis. This is because you don\'t dream much the first 5 hours,\r\nit is mostly non-REM sleep. You<BR>\r\nenter REM a lot faster after 5-6 hours with sleep, and you don\'t\r\ngo down to stage 3 and 4 as<BR>\r\nyou do when you first go to bed. The problem is remaining conscious\r\nuntil your dream start.<BR>\r\nMany strange things may happen when you remain conscious until\r\nthe REM-period starts.<BR>\r\nThe first thing you see may be Hypnagogic Imagery. It is a pattern,\r\nlike the one you see when<BR>\r\nyou press your fingers against your closed eyelids. Remember that\r\nthis is hypnotic, and getting too<BR>\r\ninvolved with them will induce unconsciousness. Just let it flow,\r\ndon\'t get too involved and<BR>\r\ndon\'t suppress them either. The next thing you may experience\r\nis Hypnagogic Sounds.<BR>\r\nIt may be as real as the sounds you hear in waking reality, but\r\nthey are nothing to be afraid of.<BR>\r\nIt is a good indicator that the REM-period is right around the\r\ncorner. Just don\'t let these sounds<BR>\r\nscare you. If you start to experience Abstract Thoughts, the logical\r\npart of your brain is<BR>\r\nfalling asleep and you are not far from losing consciousness.\r\nYou might be lying in bed<BR>\r\nthinking about a friend and the hypnagogic imagery starts and\r\nyou see your friend\'s face. You<BR>\r\nhave also worked a stressful day so you start to remember stocking\r\nthe shelves at work. Soon<BR>\r\nyou are thinking that you are putting cans of food on the shelves\r\nwith pictures of your friend<BR>\r\non them. All this might seems perfectly normal. But it\'s not logical.\r\nWhat you need to do is<BR>\r\ntry thinking logical, do some math or start over again. Tactile\r\nSensations can feel like you<BR>\r\nare paralyzed and high-voltage painless electricity is jolting\r\nthrough your body. You may<BR>\r\nexperience these vibrations and find yourself leaving your body\r\nor having a Lucid Dream. But<BR>\r\nremember that all this is nothing to fear, it happens every night,\r\nwhether you are consciously<BR>\r\naware of it or not.<BR>\r\nNow that you know what you might experience when trying to consciously\r\nenter the REM-period<BR>\r\nthere is another problem we need to conquer. And that is losing\r\nconsciousness, a very common<BR>\r\nproblem that is rather easy to overcome. A good solution is Caffeine\r\nand Theobromine. Caffeine<BR>\r\nis found in Coffee, Tea, Coke, Chocolate and Pills. Theobromine\r\nis found in Chocolate.<BR>\r\nThe problem is finding out how much Caffeine works for you. A\r\nlot of experimenting has to be conducted.<BR>\r\nA good place to start is with 0.5 liter Coke, a cup of Coffee\r\nor Tea, half a pill or a chocolate bar.<BR>\r\nIf you take too much you will not start to dream at all, if you\r\ntake too little you may lose consciousness.<BR>\r\nBut drinking 0.5 liter Coke is not very wise, it has a very disturbing\r\nside effect.<BR>\r\nYou should also stay up for about 30-60 minutes after waking up\r\nafter 5-6 hours with sleep.<BR>\r\nThis because it takes about 45 minutes before the Caffeine reaches\r\nits full effect.<BR>\r\nYou might experience a DILD if you go to sleep right after some\r\ncaffeine intake.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Another way for keeping the mind active and\r\nto bring on the hypnagogic images is to imagine<BR>\r\ndoing something that involves imagery, audible and tactile sensations.\r\nLike driving a car,<BR>\r\nimagine the car and the road, hear the engine-/radio and feel\r\nthe steering wheel. Remain<BR>\r\nfocused on what you are doing and avoid thinking about anything\r\nelse than driving that car. Or<BR>\r\nyou might include smell and taste, by imagine a good meal. This\r\nworks best in combination with<BR>\r\nNILD, it takes far more time when done as you go to sleep for\r\nthe first time. But done with<BR>\r\nNILD can you find yourself in a dream in as little as 5-10 minutes.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Or you can try lying on a 30 degree incline\r\nmattress (can be done by stuffing pillows under<BR>\r\nit). And keep the room as dark as possible. Close your eyes and\r\nconcentrate on your breathing,<BR>\r\nthe slower the better. Breath with your stomach, making an &quot;Ahhh&quot;\r\nsound at the end of the<BR>\r\nexhalation, that will help your mind to stay awake while your\r\nbody fall asleep.<BR>\r\nWith time may you notice mild vibrations and that your body becomes\r\nparalyzed.<BR>\r\nAt that point will you notice that you no longer have any problem\r\nconcentrating, everything<BR>\r\nbecomes clear. In this state stop concentrating on your breathing\r\nand just be aware of your<BR>\r\nsurroundings. If you begin to loose consciousness, start paying\r\nattention to any light in your<BR>\r\nvision or any internal sound. Some time later will you begin to\r\nexperience the second vibrations.<BR>\r\nIt will quickly rush throughout your body, sometimes accompanied\r\nby various sounds and then end.<BR>\r\nThis is your astral body being released. Dream images will start\r\nto form.<BR>\r\nYou can go with these images and enter a Lucid Dream, or you might\r\njust sit up and walk<BR>\r\naway from your physical body.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">How does the Nap Induced Lucid Dream (NILD)\r\ntechnique work?<BR>\r\nIt works by staying up for an hour or two after waking up before\r\ngoing to bed again. This has<BR>\r\nproven to be a very effective technique, maybe the most effective\r\naround. Sleep for about 5-6<BR>\r\nhours, then stay awake for about 1-2 hours and go back to sleep.<BR>\r\nMaybe doing some MILD a few minutes before falling asleep.<BR>\r\nOr try staying conscious (WILD) until the dream starts. This will\r\nin many cases cause you to<BR>\r\nhave Lucid Dreams. Also a good way to have vivid dreams, or will\r\nat least make dream recall easier.<BR>\r\nStaying awake for 90 minutes seems to work better than 60 minutes,\r\nthough 60 minutes seems to<BR>\r\nbe effective enough in most cases. And sleeping for 6 hours seems\r\nto be better than 5 hours,<BR>\r\nthough it might be harder to fall asleep again. The time spent\r\nawake should be used thinking<BR>\r\nor reading about dream related issues. Like reading about lucid\r\ndreaming or related newsgroups.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Do Lucid Dreaming induction devices work?<BR>\r\nYes. Your senses never rest. So what your senses pick up are usually\r\nincorporated into your<BR>\r\ndream, unless it wakes you up. You dream most vividly in the REM\r\n(Rapid Eye Movement) stage.<BR>\r\nA device can detect these eye movements and give you cues.<BR>\r\nCues mostly used are flashing lights and sound.<BR>\r\nThe problem with these cues is that they don\'t tell you that you\r\nare dreaming.<BR>\r\nThey usually appear in the dream as something else, like carlights.<BR>\r\nYou have to train yourself to recognize these cues as dreamsigns\r\nthat are trying to tell you that<BR>\r\nyou are dreaming. But these devices are good at causing false\r\nawakening, you will think that the<BR>\r\ndevice woke you up and try to get to sleep again. But you should\r\ndo a reality test if this happen,<BR>\r\nbecause false awakening is quite normal. Once your reality test\r\nfails, you can continue doing<BR>\r\nwhatever you want in the dream.<BR>\r\nAn even more effective approach are verbal cues. Like hearing\r\n&quot;This is a Dream&quot; or &quot;You are<BR>\r\ndreaming&quot; in your dream is a good cue to make you do a reality\r\ntest. The only problem is that<BR>\r\nsuch a solution is very expensive if you want to buy a device\r\nlike this. Therefore have we<BR>\r\nplans for making software and schematic drawings for a device\r\nthat anyone with two hands and<BR>\r\na few components can build. You will also need a computer with\r\na soundcard close to your bed.<BR>\r\nThe device may also be used for trance induction, by using binaural\r\nbeats with matching flashes.<BR>\r\n(Anyone that want to join the project, feel free to do so).<BR>\r\nI also have plans for wireless devices, a wireless EEG machine\r\ncan detect if you are dreaming<BR>\r\nor not. I will then use a wireless version of the Neurophone to\r\ngive you a verbal cue. A<BR>\r\nNeurophone is a device that uses your nervous system to send sound/music\r\nto your brain.<BR>\r\nNo ears are needed, in fact, deaf people may hear with this device.\r\n(The wireless Neurophone<BR>\r\ncan also be used for trance induction by sending the desired frequency\r\nthrough your nervous<BR>\r\nsystem). If you are a deep sleeper that don\'t see cues, then try\r\ngetting some caffeine into your<BR>\r\nsystem before going to bed or after 5-6 hours. If you are a light\r\nsleeper, so that the cues wake<BR>\r\nyou up, then cut every use of caffeine and chocolate containing\r\nproducts. And try to increase<BR>\r\nyour uptake of the amino acid Tryptophan.<BR>\r\nIf you don\'t want to build your own device, or don\'t have the\r\npatience to wait until we finish<BR>\r\nthe project. Then you can buy a device from The Lucidity Institute\r\nat www.lucidity.com, but<BR>\r\nremember that there is a DOS program called DreamWeaver that also\r\nexplains how you can<BR>\r\ncreate goggles. The Lucidity Institute will maybe publish a system\r\nfor the NovaDreamer called<BR>\r\nLISA (Lucidity Induction System for Audio). It is a computer interface\r\nthat will make it possible<BR>\r\nfor the NovaDreamer to play verbal cues.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Can Drugs and Herbs induce lucidity?<BR>\r\nYes. For more information about this check out my Dreaming FAQ.\r\nYou will find most herbs,<BR>\r\nvitamins, amino acids, minerals and drugs that help you dream\r\nmore and recall your dreams<BR>\r\nbetter. They might even cause you to have a Lucid Dream. To summarize;\r\nherbs like Valerian,<BR>\r\nMugwort, Mullein, Kava Kava, Dittany of Crete, St. Johns Wort,\r\nCalea Zacatechichi, Salvia<BR>\r\nDivinorum, Scutellaria Indica, Licorice Root, Vervain, Jasmine,\r\nHoneysuckle, Datura, Bee<BR>\r\nPollen, Catnip, Hops, Scullcap, Mimosa, Lavender, Damiana, Withania\r\nSomnifera, Passionflower,<BR>\r\nChamomile, Cardamom, Gotu Kola, Ginkgo Biloba, Ibogaine, Verbena,\r\nRose, Cinnamon, Marigold,<BR>\r\nNutmeg, Peppermint, Holly, Yarrow and Anise may help you dream\r\nmore, recall more or even have<BR>\r\na Lucid Dream. Make sure you know more about these herbs before\r\nyou use them: some are to be<BR>\r\nused in pillows, some are to be smoked, some are to be used in\r\ntea, etc. Many B-vitamins may help<BR>\r\nyou have more vivid dreams and even Lucid Dreams. Sedative drugs\r\nlike Melatonin may help, and<BR>\r\ndrugs like caffeine may help you with WILD and also make it easier\r\nto recall dreams. And finally, we<BR>\r\nhave psychedelic drugs like DXM that may induce Lucid Dreams.\r\nSome of the drugs and herbs can<BR>\r\nbe addictive, and be poisonous if taken in too large doses. For\r\na more detailed explanation you<BR>\r\nshould check out my Dreaming FAQ.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">How can I prevent premature awakening?<BR>\r\nA common problem for beginners is remaining in the dream after\r\nbecoming Lucid.<BR>\r\nThey become so excited once they realize that they are dreaming\r\nthat they wake up right away.<BR>\r\nThere are many reasons for being excited, but it will only work\r\nagainst your goal.<BR>\r\nYou need to suppress that feeling. If your dream show signs of\r\nending, maybe loss of detail or your<BR>\r\ndream just go black, then spinning may help bringing the dream\r\nback. Before you feel your physical<BR>\r\nbody you should spin your dream body. That is going round and\r\nround. Also remind yourself that the<BR>\r\nnext scene will be a dream. To ensure that it is a dream should\r\nyou do a RT. Just moving, running or<BR>\r\njumping can prolong your Lucid Dream, you might also want to try\r\nspinning out in the<BR>\r\ngravity-free universe. When you open your eyes you may be surprised\r\nto find yourself in the<BR>\r\nmost beautiful environment with stars, galaxies and planets. Another\r\ntechnique is saying out<BR>\r\nloud: &quot;Clarity now!&quot;. Just stating out loud your desire\r\nand intention may do incredible things<BR>\r\nto your dream. You might want to try other commands like: &quot;Increase\r\nlucidity now!&quot;, &quot;Create<BR>\r\nvisuals now!&quot; and &quot;Stay calm!&quot;. Theta training\r\nmay make it easier for you to stay in the Dream,<BR>\r\nit will also make it easier to induce WILD and recall Dreams.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">How can I change Lucid Dream scenery?<BR>\r\nThis can be done in many ways, but the most common technique is\r\nspinning. If you want<BR>\r\nsomething to appear, then expecting it around the corner or behind\r\nyou is quite effective.<BR>\r\nYou can find a big TV and a remote, and start changing the channels\r\nto a scene you like,<BR>\r\nthen just jump in the TV. If you want a special scene can you\r\nexpect that to appear when<BR>\r\nyou change the channels. You might also try finding a bridge,\r\nwere you see a lot of scenes<BR>\r\nflowing by. If you find you like, just jump. You might try asking\r\na dream character where you<BR>\r\nmight find what you are seeking. You can try finding a door and\r\nimagine a person/place on<BR>\r\nthe other side. And you can give slow morphing a try. You can\r\nalso try closing your eyes<BR>\r\nand imagine the scene forming around you. But the key is to expect\r\nthings to happen.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">What is DILD (Dream-Initiated Lucid Dream)?<BR>\r\nThis is a name for every Lucid Dream where you become aware that\r\nit is a dream in the dream.<BR>\r\nMeaning that you are unconscious before you become Lucid. Most\r\nLucid Dreams are DILDs.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">What is CILD (Chakra Induced Lucid Dream)?<BR>\r\nThis technique works by focusing on your Third Eye Chakra that\r\nis located slightly above and<BR>\r\nbetween your eyebrows. Set your alarm clock so that you will wake\r\nup after 6 hours. Look up<BR>\r\nand at the center of your Third Eye before closing your eyes.\r\nKeep your eyes in this position as<BR>\r\nyou close them. Give yourself appropriate affirmations until you\r\nfall asleep and visualize<BR>\r\nyourself having a lucid dream or leaving your body. If you haven\'t\r\nfallen asleep within 3<BR>\r\nminutes, move your eyes back to normal position and try to fall\r\nasleep. When the alarm clock<BR>\r\nwake you up, go to the bathroom and fresh up. For the next hour\r\nread some material on Lucid<BR>\r\nDreaming or Out of Body Experiences. After reading for an hour\r\ngo back to bed; roll your eyes<BR>\r\nback to your Third Eye. State your intentions for 3 minutes or\r\nuntil you fall asleep. One of<BR>\r\nthree things will most likely happen. You will have a Lucid Dream,\r\nhave a false awakening or<BR>\r\nwake up paralyzed that you might use to leave your body. At the\r\nvery least should you<BR>\r\nexperience vivid dreams.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">What is PILD (Punishment Induced Lucid Dream)?<BR>\r\nThis technique works by punishing yourself every time you fail\r\nto realize that you were<BR>\r\ndreaming. While going to sleep, tell yourself that you MUST become\r\nLucid this night OR you will<BR>\r\nbe punished in the morning. Various types of punishment may be\r\na cold shower or maybe an<BR>\r\nelectric shock. A 9 volt battery against your tongue maybe. This\r\ntechnique should be used in<BR>\r\ncombination with MILD. The point is to increase your intention,\r\nand it works.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">What is RILD (Reward Induced Lucid Dream)?<BR>\r\nThis technique works by rewarding yourself every time you succeed\r\nin having a Lucid Dream.<BR>\r\nVarious types of rewards may be eating a chocolate bar, or anything\r\nelse that you like<BR>\r\ndoing/eating. Have the things you want to reward yourself by your\r\nbed, or ready to use. It will<BR>\r\nincrease your intention. This technique should also be used in\r\ncombination with MILD.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">What is TILD (Thirst Induced Lucid Dream)?<BR>\r\nThis technique works by cutting out everything called drinking\r\nfor so long that you can really<BR>\r\nfeel that you are thirsty. Go to bed as normal and sleep off that\r\ndeep delta sleep, wake up<BR>\r\nafter 5-6 hours and go to the bathroom. Fill a glass with tempting,\r\nfresh cold water. Try to<BR>\r\nthink of water and doing a RT when you drink. To make the experiment\r\nmore successful<BR>\r\nyou should fill your mouth with salt so that you really feel like\r\nyou need to drink something.<BR>\r\nSet the glass of water on your night table and while you fall\r\nasleep, think on drinking the water<BR>\r\nand at the same time doing a Reality Test. You will not drink\r\nanything in the real world, so if you<BR>\r\nfind yourself drinking something, then it must be a dream. If\r\nyou want to increase the feeling<BR>\r\nof thirst even more, you should try eating some pepper or chili\r\nbefore going to sleep again.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">What is UILD (Urinate Induced Lucid Dream)?<BR>\r\nThis technique is a bit risky. It works by remembering to do a\r\nRT every time you go to the<BR>\r\nbathroom. So prior to going to bed should you drink A LOT of water.\r\nYou will maybe dream of<BR>\r\ngoing to the bathroom, and hopefully will remember doing a RT.\r\nIt\'s not the best and safest<BR>\r\ntechnique available. But it works.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">What is SILD (Sexual Induced Lucid Dream)?<BR>\r\nThis technique works by remembering to do a RT whenever you think\r\nabout sex, lovers,<BR>\r\npartners, love etc. So that whenever you think about your boyfriend/girlfriend\r\nor sex in a<BR>\r\ndream will you remember to do a RT. There is also a few approaches\r\nyou can take to make<BR>\r\nthe dream more sexual-related. The B3-vitamin Niacin increases\r\nyour production of sexual hormones.<BR>\r\nTaking Melatonin, Serotonin and/or Tryptophan will also help.<BR>\r\nThis is because the amino acid Tryptophan is metabolized into\r\nSerotonin and Niacin.<BR>\r\n(Serotonin is converted into Melatonin when you sleep). If you\r\nalready have a lot of<BR>\r\nMelatonin/Serotonin in your system more Tryptophan will be converted\r\ninto Niacin.<BR>\r\nAnd your sexual hormone production will increase. Chocolate contains\r\nPhenylalanine in large<BR>\r\nquantities, that are converted into Tyrosine that is again metabolized\r\ninto the love hormone Dopamine.<BR>\r\nSo Chocolate may also give more dreams with sexual content. Chocolate\r\nhas also Choline that<BR>\r\nwill help you dream more, Caffeine that will let you remember\r\ndreams easier and more.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">What is LILD (Letter Induced Lucid Dream)?<BR>\r\nThis technique uses a letter or symbol to induce lucidity. Day-memories\r\nare often incorporated<BR>\r\ninto the dream, especially memory from the evening. So it is quite\r\nlikely that some of what you<BR>\r\nexperience after waking up after 5-6 hours and stay up for about\r\nan hour is incorporated into<BR>\r\nthe dream. This is how this technique work. You concentrate on\r\na letter, A for Awareness during<BR>\r\nthat hour. Visualize yourself many times seeing that A and suddenly\r\nremember to do a RT.<BR>\r\nThink about this for about an hour and remember to do a Reality\r\nTest whenever you see an A.<BR>\r\nThis should also be done during the day, do a RT every time you\r\nnotice an A.<BR>\r\nWriting a word or a letter in your hand, and frequently check\r\nit might help.<BR>\r\nJust hope that you will remember to do a RT if you see a big A\r\nin the middle of the road.<BR>\r\nThe symbol in this technique can easily be changed to your dog,\r\na friend, a place or an activity.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">What is OILD (Orgone Induced Lucid Dream)?<BR>\r\nThis technique uses orgone energy to induce lucidity. Crystals\r\nand magnets have been found<BR>\r\nto send out orgone energy. But each type of crystal send out their\r\nown frequency, various orgone<BR>\r\nenergy types that do various things to our body and mind. A few\r\ncrystals that might induce<BR>\r\nLucid Dreams, or increase dream recall, clarity and vividness:\r\nHerkimer Diamond, Apophyllite,<BR>\r\nKyanite and Amethyst. The crystals should be used in correlation\r\nwith your chakras, preferably<BR>\r\nyour third eye (forehead). Magnets can work by other means than\r\nsending out orgone energy,<BR>\r\nthe pineal gland also responds to magnetism. A steady state magnetic\r\nnorth pole field will stimulate<BR>\r\nthe production of Melatonin as long as field strength in the vicinity\r\nof the pineal is in the<BR>\r\n400 mgauss range. But more is not better. So be careful. Pulsating\r\nmagnetic field will shut down<BR>\r\nthe production of Melatonin, just as light will. If you have trouble\r\nsleeping might it be wise to<BR>\r\ncheck the magnetic field around your bed.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">How can I have Shared Lucid Dreams?<BR>\r\nOnce you get experience in the field of Lucid Dreaming, have good\r\ncontrol over your dream<BR>\r\nenvironment and can stay Lucid for a long time is it time to move\r\non. Or if you are an<BR>\r\nexperienced Lucid Dreamer that wants to try something new, then\r\nShared Lucid Dreaming is<BR>\r\nan interesting approach. Intent is an important key for Sharing\r\na Dream. When you lie in bed<BR>\r\ntrying to fall asleep you need to program this intent to Share\r\nDreams with those you desire,<BR>\r\nand then when you are in the Dream, you have to recall that intent\r\nand attempt to fulfill it.<BR>\r\nGive yourself appropriate affirmations while you are waiting for\r\nthe hypnagogic imagery to start.<BR>\r\nA good way of finding those you desire is imagine them and let\r\nthe hypnagogic imagery fill out<BR>\r\nthe rest of the details. Once you are in the Dream, make sure\r\nyou are fully conscious. Check<BR>\r\nall your senses and do some logical tests. Recall your intent\r\nand try a few other techniques if<BR>\r\nyour friend isn\'t in your dream. You can phase to that person,\r\nor imagine a door and talk out<BR>\r\nloud your desire to meet that person, then open the door. You\r\ncan also shout and yell for them<BR>\r\nuntil they come along. Once you find them comes the big question.\r\nAre your friend Lucid?<BR>\r\nAsk a few simple questions, be friendly and patient. If you know\r\ntheir interest, create them. And try<BR>\r\nto make them understand that they are dreaming. Do things that\r\nnormally don\'t happen in the<BR>\r\nphysical world. When they understand or if they know that they\r\nare dreaming, make sure they<BR>\r\nare fully conscious and that all their senses are working. Once\r\nit is established that both of you<BR>\r\nare dreaming should you point out details in the dream, for later\r\nverification. You might also<BR>\r\ntry to bring more people into the dream. When you wake up you\r\nshould write down everything<BR>\r\nyou could remember, especially the details that were pointed out.\r\nA phone call right after<BR>\r\nawakening may help on the recall.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">How can I have Precognitive Lucid Dreams?<BR>\r\nWhen you have some successful experience with Shared Lucid Dreaming\r\nyou can give<BR>\r\nPrecognitive Lucid Dreams a try. Intent is also an important key\r\nto have Precognitive Lucid Dreams.<BR>\r\nWhen you lie in bed trying to fall asleep you need to program\r\nthis intent to have a Precognitive Dream,<BR>\r\nand when your Dream starts do you have to recall that intent.\r\nYou should give yourself appropriate<BR>\r\naffirmations while you are waiting for the hypnagogic imagery\r\nto start. When the dream starts do you<BR>\r\nneed to check your level of consciousness. Do all the tests and\r\nmake sure your logical mind is working.<BR>\r\nThe next thing you need to do is fully focus on your intent. Make\r\nit perfectly clear, shut your eyes, shut<BR>\r\ndown all signals from the dream and let go. Move into the field\r\nby intuitively driving yourself with the<BR>\r\ndesire to go there. Let go and fell yourself moving towards your\r\ndesired source. Let time and space<BR>\r\ngo, just flow with your intention. You may feel a melt down for\r\na second until before you arrive there.<BR>\r\nWherever you are in time or space will happen later in the physical\r\nworld. Just observe whatever<BR>\r\nhappen and enjoy it. Remember to write it down when you wake up,\r\nfor later verification.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">How can I use Dreams to affect physical matter?<BR>\r\nThis can be done in the Precognitive field. When you are in a\r\nPrecognitive Lucid Dream, all you<BR>\r\nneed to do is try to move objects around, or make various marks\r\non other people. Not only do<BR>\r\nyou have the ability to move matter, you can also create electricity,\r\nmagnetic fields, light,<BR>\r\nheat, sound and matter. You can also form and dissolve matter.\r\nYou can do this on the lowest<BR>\r\nplane, the physical plane in the precognitive field. Being in\r\nthe physical plane is usually<BR>\r\ncalled OBE (Out of Body Experience). But you don\'t need to be\r\nin the precognitive field to<BR>\r\naffect matter, being in the physical plane is enough.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">How can I have Shared Precognitive Lucid Dreams?<BR>\r\nWhen you feel that you have good control over Shared Lucid Dreams\r\nand Precognitive<BR>\r\nLucid Dreams you can give Shared Precognitive Lucid Dreams a try.\r\nWhat you need to<BR>\r\ndo is find the person you what to Share the Dream with. After\r\nall the usual tests are done<BR>\r\nand both of you are fully conscious, do you need to agree on the\r\nsame intent. Agree on the<BR>\r\ntime and space and do the same as you were trying to have a Precognitive\r\nLucid Dream.<BR>\r\nHolding hands may make it easier for you to stay together. Since\r\nyou are two or more will you<BR>\r\nmost likely have more success affecting the physical world, since\r\nmore energy is concentrated.<BR>\r\nAs always, write down your experience for later verification.\r\nIf you are looking for scientific<BR>\r\nevidence, try reading up on the paranormal section in my Dreaming\r\nFAQ.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">How can I stop real time in my Lucid Dreams?<BR>\r\nStopping real time in your Lucid Dreams means making the Lucid\r\nDream last far more than the<BR>\r\ntime passed by in the physical world. Like having a dream that\r\nlast a few minutes in real time,<BR>\r\nwhile you might experience it as a few days in the dream. By doing\r\nthis can you enjoy the dream<BR>\r\nscape a lot more, since you can spend days in the dream while\r\nit really just last a few<BR>\r\nminutes. Robert Monroe even reported experiencing 100 years in\r\na 2 hours OOBE. But to<BR>\r\nexperience this might be difficult, little research have been\r\ndone on this area. And those that<BR>\r\nexperience it don\'t consciously try to have them. Still, there\r\nare a few techniques you might<BR>\r\ntry. First of all, set your intention to stop real time. Have\r\nthat intention in mind while<BR>\r\nhaving your Lucid Dream. Picture yourself being in the dream for\r\ndays, maybe even weeks<BR>\r\nbefore you wake up. You might try to saying out loud: &quot;Stop\r\ntime now!&quot; You can try looking<BR>\r\nat your clock in the dream, and imagine that the clock slow down\r\nand stop. You might try to<BR>\r\nexpect the dream to last for days. You might try visualize two\r\npyramids, connected at their<BR>\r\nbases counterrotating. And maybe visualize multiple pyramids rotating\r\ninside each other all rotating.<BR>\r\nThis is something worth going for, as it may give you incredible\r\nlong Lucid Dreams.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">How can I leave my body from a Lucid Dream?<BR>\r\nAs you may have understood by now dreams take place outside your\r\nbody.<BR>\r\nThey are happening in the mental plane where you might meet other\r\npeople or easily go down to<BR>\r\nthe physical plane and travel in time and space. Being in a reality\r\nwhere you can do whatever you<BR>\r\nwant is much more fun than being stuck in the physical plane.\r\nBut exploring the physical world can<BR>\r\nalso be fun, and many different and useful things can be done\r\non the physical plane.<BR>\r\nOne technique is imagine a door and talk out loud your desire\r\nto enter the physical location when<BR>\r\nyou go through that door.<BR>\r\nAs you may have understood by now dreams take place outside your\r\nbody.<BR>\r\nThey are happening in the mental plane where you might meet other\r\npeople or easily go down to<BR>\r\nthe physical plane and travel in time and space.

More techniques on how you can\r\nleave your body can be<BR>\r\nfound on my Out of Body Experience FAQ.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">How can I use Lucid Dreams to read 1 million\r\nwords per minute?<BR>\r\nTo reach speeds as high as 1 million words per minute a computer\r\nprogram that can show 30<BR>\r\nframes each second with 550 words must be developed.<BR>\r\nA video camera and a TV might also produce such high speeds.<BR>\r\nBut a computer program might show E-texts and maybe also allow\r\nsearching for desired information<BR>\r\non the web. This technique works by using the power of your subconscious.\r\nYour subconscious has<BR>\r\nthe ability to process enormous amount of information. Until the\r\ncomputer program is developed you<BR>\r\ncan use a little variation.And that is using normal books. Since\r\nit takes some time turning each page<BR>\r\nof the book does the speed drop to about 25,000-50,000 wpm. Before\r\nsending the pages in the book<BR>\r\nfor processing to your subconscious you should enter a trance\r\nstate, preferably the theta state.<BR>\r\nTurning the pages of the book will make it difficult to keep that\r\nstate. But it can be done with practice.<BR>\r\n(The computer program will include flashing screen and binaural\r\nbeats to put you down in the desired<BR>\r\nstate before sending the pages to your subconscious). To send\r\nthe most of the information in the book<BR>\r\nto your subconscious you can\'t have a hard focus on the book or\r\nscreen.<BR>\r\nIf you are reading a book you should place your focus some place\r\nbehind the book. This will be<BR>\r\na lot easier with a computer program. Because it will include\r\nstereograms in the background<BR>\r\nthat you may try to focus on. (Stereograms are pictures where\r\nyou have to diverge to see the<BR>\r\n3D-picture.) Before starting the reading should you give yourself\r\nappropriate affirmations.<BR>\r\nYou will have no recall of what you just read once you are finished.\r\nAt least not at first.<BR>\r\nThis is where Lucid Dreaming comes into the picture. While Lucid\r\nDreaming you have access to<BR>\r\nall the information that your subconscious has stored throughout\r\nhistory. But the beauty with<BR>\r\nLucid Dreaming is that you can let your subconscious process the\r\ninformation for you.<BR>\r\nYou might imagine meeting the author of the book you read around\r\nthe corner.<BR>\r\nOnce you meet him can you start asking all the questions you were\r\nseeking answer for in the book.<BR>\r\nAnd your subconscious will provide the right answers. Even where\r\nin the book you will find that answer.<BR>\r\nIf you read a novel can you sit down in the most comfortable chair\r\nyou can think of, imagine a big<BR>\r\nscreen TV with 3D-cinema sound. Then you might start watching\r\nthe novel while eating popcorn.<BR>\r\nBut this should be done in the weekend when you can sleep for\r\nabout 12 hours.<BR>\r\nThe 4 last hours will almost be a continual long REM. Great for\r\nwatching movies.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">9/9/01<BR>\r\n</FONT>\r\n\r\n</BODY>',

They may include everything from being teased at\r\nschool by our \'friends\' to<BR>\r\nemotional, physical, or mental abuse by parents, loved ones, etc.<BR>\r\nThe purpose of this rite is to draw these hidden memories up into\r\na closed box, open it in a<BR>\r\nmanner similar to the Pandora myth, and meet, greet, and make\r\npeace with the<BR>\r\nmemories, as they can be very detrimental to one\'s ego growth\r\nif kept hidden.<BR>\r\nInstead of finding hope in our boxes though, we will find acceptance,\r\nand peace with<BR>\r\noneself, and one\'s past.<BR>\r\nThis rite is good for anyone, even those who assume they have\r\nhad perfect childhood\'s.<BR>\r\nYou don\'t always realize the past is dragging you down until it\r\nis too late, and you would<BR>\r\nbe amazed by what you can find out about yourself!<BR>\r\nYou will need:<BR>\r\nYellow candles Kamea of sol A box of any shape, or size A solar\r\nincense<BR>\r\n(And, music of a childlike nature may be used to enhance the atmosphere.)<BR>\r\nPreparation:<BR>\r\nThe box should have a lid.<BR>\r\nPaint the inside glossy black, or line it with an irregular reflective\r\nsurface, such as aluminum foil.<BR>\r\nThe outside should be decorated with any drawings, pictures, or\r\nwhatever one may want to<BR>\r\nhelp evoke a childlike state of mind, and to help trigger childhood\r\nmemories.<BR>\r\nStart with an opening of any sort you feel comfortable with.<BR>\r\nLight candles and incense as desired.<BR>\r\nState the intent: &quot;It is my will to greet my past, and accept\r\nit for what it is.&quot;<BR>\r\nRecite the invocation:<BR>\r\n&quot;I call the past to meet the present,<BR>\r\nthat the future may be bright.<BR>\r\nI bring myself forth from the dark,<BR>\r\nand hold me to the light.<BR>\r\nLet not the past control my present,<BR>\r\nlet not my future be dark as night.<BR>\r\nI meet and greet me with open arms,<BR>\r\nand move back into the light.&quot;<BR>\r\nAt this point, one person sits in the center of the group with\r\ntheir box, keeping it closed.<BR>\r\nShe focuses on the box while the rest of the participants circle\r\naround, teasing, insulting,<BR>\r\ndegrading her. At this point, the teasing should not be too personal.<BR>\r\nWhen she reaches gnosis, she opens the box, and gazes inside,\r\nseeing whatever she sees.<BR>\r\nAt this point, the taunting should reach a more personal, and\r\nvicious attitude.<BR>\r\nThis continues until they close their box again.<BR>\r\nThe box then is dealt with in whatever manner she sees fit.<BR>\r\nIt can be destroyed, left open in a spot of sunlight, kept for\r\nfuture uses, as it may be a<BR>\r\ngood idea to do this more than once.

Commercials and disc <BR>\r\njockey blather tend to make you lose you concentration. <BR>\r\nPick a time of day that you will not be disturbed, and one that\r\nfits into your schedule. At first, block <BR>\r\nout only ten minutes time, then extend it as your proficiency\r\nand patience grows. When you can <BR>\r\nsuccessfully meditate anywhere, you will know you\'ve got the hang\r\nof it. <BR>\r\nIn the beginning, the lighting in the room should be dim -- soft\r\ncandlelight is excellent. Try not to <BR>\r\nwear restrictive clothing, and find a comfortable chair, but not\r\none so soothing that you will instantly <BR>\r\nfall asleep. You do not have to twist yourself into a pretzel\r\nto successfully meditate. I personally think <BR>\r\nthat this is one reason why Eastern forms of meditation died quickly\r\nin the seventies; we Americans <BR>\r\nare used to the couch potato position. <BR>\r\nBe sure that the volume of the music is not too loud. You might\r\nuse headphones because they block <BR>\r\nout all other sounds. <BR>\r\nBegin by closing your eyes and consciously relaxing your body.\r\nSome people prefer to relax the <BR>\r\nbody one part at a time, starting at the feet and working up to\r\nthe top of the head. Others can <BR>\r\nconsciously release tension in a few seconds. Breathe deeply --\r\nin to the count of four, out to the <BR>\r\ncount of four -- approximately ten times. <BR>\r\nLet your mind slip into a semi-conscious state. Try to ignore\r\ntingles, itches, etc., but don\'t make a <BR>\r\nmajor battle out of it. Eventually your body will not protest\r\nrelaxing! <BR>\r\nNow it is time to make believe. Don\'t laugh! Wishes and make believe\r\nare the same as reality, it is <BR>\r\nonly you who draws the line between the two. <BR>\r\nSo, make believe that you are a fountain of sparkling blue light,\r\nor a waterfall, perhaps. This light <BR>\r\nsprings from the top of your head and showers down your right\r\nside, swirls around your feet and <BR>\r\ncomes back up the left side. Watch this continuous flow of light\r\nfrom your third eye (which is located <BR>\r\nin the middle of your forehead, above the bridge of your nose).\r\nWhen this is fully opened, it is a <BR>\r\npowerful and natural tool. <BR>\r\nDon\'t get excited if you can\'t &quot;see&quot; right away as if\r\nyou are watching an inner movie. <BR>\r\nIt can take up to thirty days to bring the picture in focus for\r\nsome; as little as five days for others. <BR>\r\nDo not put yourself under pressure. Many people have their imagination\r\non a very tight lease for <BR>\r\nfear that society in general will frown upon them. In the privacy\r\nof your meditation, no one will <BR>\r\nknow or care about your imagination, so let it go. <BR>\r\nContinue the fountain exercise for one full week before going\r\nfurther. This will give your body <BR>\r\nand mind time to adjust to a new routine and react the way you\r\nwant it to. <BR>\r\nEnd each exercise by envisioning yourself being zipped up like\r\na sleeping bag and counting <BR>\r\nbackwards from ten to one. At one, open your eyes and instruct\r\nyourself to fully awaken. <BR>\r\nDuring the second week you should follow the same procedures,\r\nbut this time you will continue <BR>\r\nyour meditation after you complete the fountain by opening up\r\nthe Chakra center. You can <BR>\r\nenvision them as tumbling balls of colored light, the opening\r\nof colored flowers (like a rose or a <BR>\r\nlotus), or as spirals of colored light. <BR>\r\nStart at the crown of your head and envision a pure white ball\r\n(flower, etc.) of sparkling light. <BR>\r\nStart the ball spinning in a downward rotation, yet the ball remains\r\nin place. When you have <BR>\r\nthis center set in your mind continue to the next Chakra. This\r\none is purple and located at the <BR>\r\nthird eye area we talked about earlier. When that one is spinning\r\nand stable, move to the throat <BR>\r\nChakra, where you will find a beautiful azure blue ball. Next\r\nis the heart Chakra, which can be <BR>\r\nenvisioned as either bright green or warm pink. Move down to your\r\nnavel and see yellow, as <BR>\r\nbright as summer sunshine; the area below it, between the navel\r\nand groin, see the orange of <BR>\r\nthe setting sun. The last Chakra is in the groin area, and it\r\nis crimson red. There are also energy <BR>\r\ncenters in the hands and feet; I let them explode all together\r\ninto small, white balls of light. <BR>\r\nThe third week you will try the hardest trick. Once you have all\r\nthe balls spinning, let their colors <BR>\r\nflow into one another, like a giant, colorful waterfall or fountain\r\n-- hence, fountain meditation. <BR>\r\nWhen you are finished, imagine a zipper the length of your body.\r\nYou must close up that zipper to <BR>\r\nshut down the chakras; never leave them open. As before, count\r\nfrom ten to one, then tell yourself <BR>\r\nyou are fully awake. Breathe deeply. You have successfully completed\r\nthe first leg of a full meditation. <BR>\r\nLet\'s stop here and consider if none of this has been working\r\nfor you. First, you must believe that it is <BR>\r\ngoing to work from the beginning. If you are having any doubts,\r\nthey are probably affecting your <BR>\r\nsubconscious. Try writing some affirmations or taping to yourself\r\nto solve this dilemma. You may <BR>\r\nalso try working the chakras from the groin area up. <BR>\r\nMeditation may not work if you are overly tired or not in the\r\nappropriate atmosphere. <BR>\r\nThere are certain times in the day where people are more in sync\r\nthan others. If mornings <BR>\r\nare good for you usually, try meditating in the early hours instead\r\nof night time. <BR>\r\nA complete meditation is designed to accomplish something. A partial\r\nmeditation, like the <BR>\r\nfountain, is structured to balance the chakras and relieve stress.\r\nWhen you are finished with <BR>\r\nthe partial meditation, you should feel rested and relaxed, yet\r\nenergized. <BR>\r\nIf you fall asleep during the exercise, do not worry too much\r\nabout it. Your body is telling you <BR>\r\nthat you need the rest. If this happens often, check your seating,\r\nlighting, and the time of day. <BR>\r\nPerhaps one or more could be changed to keep you from dozing off.<BR>\r\nAs you become more capable of controlling your meditation exercises,\r\nyou can investigate complete <BR>\r\nmeditations that incorporate creative visualization techniques,\r\nsubliminals or visualization training. <BR>\r\nIf you are still having difficulty with meditation at this point,\r\nyou should try a subliminal tape designed for that purpose.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">GEMINI ENERGY POWDER<BR>\r\nYou can use this magical Mercury powder by itself, or add the\r\npowder to other forms <BR>\r\nof magick - such as at the bottom of a candle or in a cauldron-\r\nto find information and <BR>\r\nencourage communications. <BR>\r\nTo start, find and mix the following ingredients with a mortal\r\nand pestle: <BR>\r\n--dried white rose petals, silver glitter, blue powder, dried\r\nVervain, and dried orris root. <BR>\r\nWith your finger or a pencil, draw the symbol of Mercury and the\r\nsymbol of Gemini in <BR>\r\nthe powder. Hold your hands over the powder, asking that the mixture\r\nbe instilled with<BR>\r\nthe dynamic energies of Gemini. Store the powder in a plastic\r\nbag that contains <BR>\r\na moonstone. To put to use, place a teaspoon of the Mercury powder\r\nin the palm <BR>\r\nof your hand and blow off your fingers as you ask the element\r\nof air to speed your <BR>\r\nrequest and return the necessary details to you as quickly as\r\npossible.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">ENERGY WORK<BR>\r\nTo be effective at energy work it is of great value to know how\r\nto ground and center <BR>\r\nyourself connecting with the spiritual heart of the earth and\r\nSource and calling yourself <BR>\r\ntogether aligning your thoughts and personal entirety in a solid\r\nfocused state. <BR>\r\nthis is a frequent basic practice in virtually all forms of spiritual\r\nwork , healing, meditation, <BR>\r\nmanifestation , protection releasing and is of itself often profoundly\r\nhealing not only should <BR>\r\nevery one learn to ground in the way they feel most comfortable\r\nwith. <BR>\r\nSeeing that the person you are treating knows how to ground may\r\nbe the most valuable <BR>\r\npart of healing and energy work sessions. <BR>\r\nSENSING ENERGY<BR>\r\nMany people find that if they rub their hands together vigorously\r\nfirst they can feel <BR>\r\nenergy more easily . After rubbing your hands together vigorously\r\nto sensitize them if <BR>\r\nthis helps you be more aware of energy, Run your hands over your\r\nown body or that of the <BR>\r\nbeing wanting a treatment holding your hands about an inch away\r\nfrom the physical body. <BR>\r\nFeel for hot and cold spots in the energy field. <BR>\r\nPull out and throw away anything you feel intuitively that you\r\nshould pull out and envision <BR>\r\nhealing light filling any place where you remove blocks or that\r\nfeels empty or that you feel <BR>\r\nneeds it. Combing and fluffing the aura with your fingers as though\r\ncombing hair can also <BR>\r\nhelp clear and lighten the aura. You can also feel for the energy\r\nof the Chakra and encourage <BR>\r\nthem to be open and clear and be well seated in the central energy\r\nchannel. <BR>\r\nIf you feel sticky or dark energy as you do this you can give\r\nit to Spirit, the Light, <BR>\r\nEarth to be transformed. In addition to pulling out blocks and\r\novercharges in the energy field. <BR>\r\nVisualize and allow spiritual healing energy to flow freely and\r\nfill and charge the person or other, <BR>\r\nbeing treated do not try to do anything just allow it to happen\r\nyou are not using your own personal <BR>\r\nchi because while many healers do use it you could drain yourself\r\nif you did and create illness in <BR>\r\nyour self. Using the universal spiritual chi is more effective\r\nin any case. </FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">POWER MEDITATION<BR>\r\nYou should begin by considering your own body, particularly your\r\nbreathing. This is <BR>\r\nnot difficult, merely finding yourself a comfortable chair in\r\nwhich you can sit without falling<BR>\r\nasleep. You should try to find a place where you will not be disturbed.\r\nNot because<BR>\r\ndisturbances are dangerous, but because you may find yourself\r\nenjoying the relaxed state so<BR>\r\nmuch that being brought suddenly out of it by an offending family\r\nmember may cause you to <BR>\r\nlose your temper.<BR>\r\nOnce you have found your spot, sit quietly for about 10 minutes\r\nat a time. That is how<BR>\r\nyou start. Just by sitting and doing nothing, and while sitting\r\ntry to notice how your body<BR>\r\nreacts. Notice that twitch you have? Feel your lungs filling with\r\nair, rising and falling,<BR>\r\npushing out our rib cage and letting it fall back in.<BR>\r\nAs you sit, notice all of these things. Your body has certain\r\nplaces that are naturally<BR>\r\ntense. You will hear things you normally ignore. That is not really\r\nso strange.<BR>\r\nEveryone experiences it when they are falling asleep at night\r\n(i.e.. the creaking of the<BR>\r\nhouse). Pay very close attention to all of these things and you\r\nwill discover something<BR>\r\ninteresting. The more you listen to your own body, the less you\r\nare bothered by the <BR>\r\nthoughts of the day. This is because your conscious mind can only\r\nhandle one piece of data at a time.<BR>\r\nIf you are studying intently, you are unaware of what is going\r\non around you. The more you<BR>\r\npractice, the more effective your mind becomes at blocking out\r\nunwelcome stimuli.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">POWER SPOTS<BR>\r\nJust as humans have power points, the earth also has areas where\r\nenergy varies. <BR>\r\nThese are called power spots. Places like Stonehenge, and the\r\nValley of the Dead are <BR>\r\nexamples of power spots. Just as human beings have areas where\r\ntheir energy is more <BR>\r\nconcentrated, so does the earth. Most of the older churches and\r\ntemples were built on <BR>\r\npower spots, where it is much easier to connect with the spiritual\r\nrealms. When you approach <BR>\r\na sacred place, you can feel it\'s power and the strength that\r\nlies there. These places can <BR>\r\nbe used to intensify your personal power and to assist you in\r\nconnecting more fully with <BR>\r\nyour spiritual center.<BR>\r\nWhenever you enter a room you automatically gravitate toward a\r\nplace that feels comfortable. <BR>\r\nThe place that you feel most comfortable in is often your personal\r\npower spot. It is the place that <BR>\r\nbalances most closely with your own energy. As you stand or sit\r\nin this spot, your energy is magnified; <BR>\r\nit is like putting jumper cables on a car battery. The ability\r\nto consciously find these power spots <BR>\r\ncan greatly enhance your sensitivities to energy and your own\r\nprocess. <BR>\r\nBeing able to find these is like many of the other exercises in\r\nthis book; they all allow you to <BR>\r\nknow a little more about yourself than you did before.<BR>\r\nI suggest you find your power spot in nature. In any given location,\r\nthere is a place that fits <BR>\r\nyou better energetically than any other location. There are also\r\nplaces that can drain your energy <BR>\r\nand make you feel and act less effectively. It is important to\r\nbe able to tell the difference. <BR>\r\nOne spot may energize you while another weakens you and can actually\r\nmake you sick.<BR>\r\nThere are three major types of power spots. One type gives you\r\nenergy and is healing. <BR>\r\nAnother type of spot actually drains energy from anything within\r\nits boundaries. <BR>\r\nThere are also power spots that are tricksters. They confuse people\r\nand trick them into <BR>\r\ngiving up their power and sanity. It takes practice to be able\r\nto differentiate between them. <BR>\r\nThe easiest way to tell between the types is by how you feel.\r\nIt is important to trust how you <BR>\r\nfeel and what you sense as you explore the energy levels of the\r\ndifferent types of power spots. <BR>\r\nThese spots affect you whether you are consciously aware of them\r\nor not.<BR>\r\nBegin by calling upon your protector and ask the universe for\r\nguidance. <BR>\r\nRelax and focus on your breathing. Slowly look around the area.\r\nDoes one spot &quot;look&quot; <BR>\r\nbrighter than the other? See how each section feels as you stand\r\nin it. Feel from your heart. <BR>\r\nDo some feel lighter and some heavy? Do you feel confused as you\r\nstand in some places? <BR>\r\nNow slowly walk around the area. Take time to stand in any place\r\nthat attracts you. <BR>\r\nCompare how each one feels to you. Notice the plants and grasses\r\nin the various areas. <BR>\r\nDo they look healthier in one place, greener and more alive? <BR>\r\nLet your self look intuitively where your power place is.<BR>\r\nNow sit down and begin to meditate. How do you feel as you sit\r\nin that spot? <BR>\r\nDoes the energy feel loving and peaceful? If it feels rough or\r\nunsettling, move. <BR>\r\nSoon it will become second nature; you will automatically sit\r\nin your power spot. <BR>\r\nAvoid listening to your mind during this process. Trust the inner\r\nknowing. <BR>\r\nYour inner knowing, your sacred self, will never lie to you.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">POWER POINTS<BR>\r\nScattered over the surface of an individual\'s aura are various\r\npower points. <BR>\r\nThese points are areas where a person\'s energy varies in density\r\nor form, appearing <BR>\r\neither thicker or thinner than the rest of his or her energy field.\r\nEnergy can be channeled <BR>\r\ninto these points so the person can experience healing or have\r\nhis/her consciousness <BR>\r\npushed into another reality.<BR>\r\nThe human aura is actually a complex web of energy fibers. Power\r\npoints are areas <BR>\r\nwhere these fibers intersect or join. By <BR>\r\nmanipulating these points you can rearrange the fibers to adjust\r\nthe person\'s energy field. <BR>\r\nMoving these fibers can change the person on an emotional, spiritual,\r\nor physical level. <BR>\r\nThis in turn can heal a person of physical diseases or emotional\r\nturmoil. It can also bring <BR>\r\nhim/her closer to the sacred self.<BR>\r\nAs with any technique, learning how to sense power spots will\r\ntake patience and diligence. <BR>\r\nIt is something we learn to do <BR>\r\nintuitively, not intellectually. You will have to work with a\r\npartner. One person should sit <BR>\r\ncomfortably in a chair while the other person practices locating\r\nthat person\'s power points. <BR>\r\nTo locate your partner\'s power points, stand behind the person\r\nand relax. <BR>\r\nAllow yourself to go into a light meditative state. As much as\r\npossible release your mind. <BR>\r\nIn order to feel another person\'s power points, you must see with\r\nyour spiritual eyes, you <BR>\r\ndon\'t see as much as feel; you sense at a deep level of you being.\r\nAfter you are relaxed, <BR>\r\nslowly begin to move your hands over the other person\'s body,\r\nbeing sure not to touch the body.<BR>\r\nPlace your hands about six inches from the body and notice how\r\nit feels. <BR>\r\nPlace all you attention to the area between your hands and the\r\nperson\'s body. <BR>\r\nClose your eyes and breathe deeply; let your mind relax. What\r\ndo you see? What can you sense?<BR>\r\nAllow your hands to become sensitive to the temperature and texture\r\nof the person\'s body. <BR>\r\nMove your hands in and out as well as over the surface of the\r\nbody\'s energy field. <BR>\r\nStay relaxed and breathe deeply. Don\'t try too hard. <BR>\r\nSimply allow yourself to really feel from deep within your being.<BR>\r\nInstead of thinking with your head, feel with your heart. <BR>\r\nAsk the universe for help in sensing this person\'s power points,\r\nand let your sacred self guide you.<BR>\r\nAt first, as you move your hands over a certain spot you may feel\r\na strange pulling or tugging at <BR>\r\nyour hands. This is a power point. It may feel like a slight shift\r\nin temperature. A particular <BR>\r\nspot may feel warmer or cooler. Certain areas may feel sluggish\r\nor sticky or you may feel <BR>\r\nstatic electricity. Allow yourself to be sensitive to any change\r\nin sensations. <BR>\r\nTrust your inner knowing. <BR>\r\nDon\'t debate it with your mind. If you think it is a power point,\r\nit is a power point.<BR>\r\nOnce you find a power point, ask the person how it feels as you\r\nmove your hand over it. <BR>\r\nWithout touching the individual, ask him/her where you are working.<BR>\r\nBoth of you then can build the sensitivity. <BR>\r\nTake turns practicing until you can easily locate at least several\r\npoints on each other. <BR>\r\nThe locations of the power points varies from person to person,\r\nand from one day to another.<BR>\r\nBe patient with yourself. Learning how to feel and sense on these\r\nlevels is a new experience <BR>\r\nfor your mind. You have been trained most of your life to filter\r\nout any information you receive <BR>\r\nfrom these levels. When you learned to walk as a child, you fell\r\ndown often. If you had given <BR>\r\nup, you would still be in your crib or crawling around on your\r\nhands and knees. Be patient with <BR>\r\nyourself. Let yourself learn how to walk through these new levels.\r\nHave fun and enjoy the process.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">POWER MOVES<BR>\r\nPower moves are movements that we make with our bodies that assist\r\nus in concentrating <BR>\r\nand directing the energy. Most martial art use power moves to\r\none degree or another. <BR>\r\nWhen people dance from their hearts, they are doing power moves,\r\nallowing the power to speak <BR>\r\nthrough their bodies. Power moves are a dance of power. Tai Chi\r\nis an ancient example of power moves.<BR>\r\nWhenever you handle energy, you receive it with your left hand\r\nand send it with your right hand. <BR>\r\nYour left hand acts as an antenna and your right hand broadcasts\r\nthe energy you have received. <BR>\r\nIf you are open to its direction, power will instruct you-it will\r\n&quot;tell&quot; you what to do. <BR>\r\nFlowing with that energy can be a powerful and centering experience.<BR>\r\nIt can also be distressing when you fight it or cannot control\r\nit.<BR>\r\nThis dance of power begins as you relax and become mentally centered.\r\n<BR>\r\nStand quietly with your legs shoulder-width apart. <BR>\r\nMentally give the power permission to flow through you and ask\r\nit to guide you. <BR>\r\nRaise your hands and hold them in front of you. <BR>\r\nLet your hands and body move as you feel guided. <BR>\r\nYour movements will be smooth and rhythmic, almost like a ballet.<BR>\r\nPower moves are a form of moving meditation. They are relaxing\r\nand energizing. <BR>\r\nAs you do them, you collect a great deal of power in your body.<BR>\r\nThey are healing to both mind and body. If it feels appropriate,\r\nyou can play gentle <BR>\r\nmusic or light a candle. Relax and let the energy move your body.<BR>\r\nNotice how it feels as it flows through you. <BR>\r\nAfter you have relaxed into the energy, allow it to move you for\r\nabout fifteen minutes and <BR>\r\nthen stop. Gently sit down and close your eyes. Ask the universe\r\nhow to use the energy <BR>\r\nyou have collected. If you don\'t get a specific answer, send the\r\nenergy to Mother Earth <BR>\r\nso it can heal the planet, yourself, and the people you love.\r\nAllow yourself to bathe in the <BR>\r\njoy of that energy. If you are having a difficult time feeling\r\nthe guidance of the energy, <BR>\r\nstart with your hands. Hold them in front of your face and move\r\nyour right hand clockwise <BR>\r\nand your left hand counter- clockwise. Move them slowly and rhythmically\r\nin and out. <BR>\r\nGently notice how it feels. Then while you are sitting in a chair,\r\nbegin moving your legs <BR>\r\nin a circular motion, noticing how it feels. After you are comfortable\r\nwith those movements, <BR>\r\nstand up and again begin with your hands. First move one hand\r\nout and away from you and <BR>\r\nthen step rhythmically out with one of your legs. Next do the\r\nsame with the other hand and leg. <BR>\r\nSlowly begin moving around the room. Notice your body and let\r\nyourself enjoy its movements. <BR>\r\nAllow the process to be sensual and rhythmic. Be gentle with yourself\r\nas you practice allowing <BR>\r\nyour awareness to expand. Enjoy the process.<BR>\r\nEXERCISES:<BR>\r\n1. Practice finding power spots wherever you go.<BR>\r\n2. Find your special power spot. We all have places on this earth\r\nthat are sacred to us. <BR>\r\nTake time to find your sacred place. Once you find it, spend some\r\ntime there. <BR>\r\nLet that place heal you and fill you with its love. Let your heart\r\nguide you to that place. <BR>\r\nIt will call to you if you are willing to listen.<BR>\r\n3. Buy a packet of seeds and divide it in half. Do some power\r\nmoves and then sit quietly <BR>\r\nwith half of the seeds. Allow yourself to feel their life energy\r\nand then slowly begin <BR>\r\nchanneling energy to them. Mentally see them growing big and strong.\r\nPlant each <BR>\r\ngroup of seeds in separate pots and give them equal care. <BR>\r\nNotice how much healthier the energized group is.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">TO LOSE YOUR TROUBES <BR>\r\nTake a handful of earth and gaze into it. <BR>\r\nPut all your troubles and thoughts of distress into it. <BR>\r\nState exactly what it is that\'s troubling you. <BR>\r\nWhen finished, throw the dirt behind you and walk away without\r\nturning around to look at it. <BR>\r\nAlso works with rocks.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">9/9/01</FONT>\r\n\r\n</BODY>',

Remember that magic tends to build upon itself...it\r\ngrows stronger with repetition...<BR>\r\ndon\'t be discouraged if you have to repeat this spell several\r\ntimes...it CAN and WILL work&#133;</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">BANISHMENT OR HEALING SPELL<BR>\r\nThis spell can be used for a variety of banishing needs: banishing\r\nillnesses<BR>\r\n(therefore it\'s a healing spell), bad habits, negativity, etc.,<BR>\r\nYou will need:<BR>\r\n&middot; Carbon or flash paper &middot; Business size envelope<BR>\r\n&middot; A slip of paper that will fit in the envelope &middot;\r\nAppropriate herbs<BR>\r\nHealing: Eucalyptus, Rosemary, Sandalwood, Juniper, Thyme, Willow<BR>\r\nBanishing: Basil, Asafoetida**, Valerian, Black Pepper, Patchouli,<BR>\r\nAgrimony, Acacia, Cypress<BR>\r\n&middot; Appropriately colored candles<BR>\r\nHealing: Green, Blue Banishing: Black Fast Action: Red<BR>\r\n&middot; Appropriate oil for anointing the candles<BR>\r\nHealing: Eucalyptus, Rosemary, Sandalwood<BR>\r\nBanishing: Basil, Cypress, Acacia, Frankincense<BR>\r\n&middot; Appropriate incense<BR>\r\n&middot; Charcoal for the incense if necessary<BR>\r\n&middot; A disposable pen in black ink<BR>\r\nAt the full moon anoint and charge the candles with the essential\r\noil and bless<BR>\r\nand charge the herbs you are going to use. Surround the base of\r\nthe candles<BR>\r\nwith the appropriate herbs and light the candles, cast your circle\r\nor otherwise<BR>\r\nprepare for magic as you normally would.<BR>\r\nCut a human figure out of the carbon paper (designed appropriately\r\nas specifically<BR>\r\nmale for men, female for women) that will fit inside the envelope.\r\nOf course, if you<BR>\r\nneed to, you can use a larger envelope but the business size is\r\ngenerally sufficient.<BR>\r\nLay the figure on the slip of paper between the candles, charge\r\nand name it as the I<BR>\r\nindividual and with intent write on the figure what you are working\r\non. Such as, if the<BR>\r\nspell is to heal an illness you might simply write whatever that\r\nillness is, in example:<BR>\r\n&quot;cold/flu.&quot; You might also write it over the appropriate\r\nbody part, such as if it is a head<BR>\r\ncold write it on the head. If it\'s to overcome an addiction to\r\ncigarettes you might write<BR>\r\n&quot;cigarettes&quot; on the chest (or where ever you identify\r\nmost with smoking) and even add<BR>\r\na cigarette in the envelope! Be creative with it.<BR>\r\nCharge both the paper and the doll with intent, by the elements,\r\netc., and place them<BR>\r\nand some of the herbs in the envelope and seal it up. Lay it between\r\nthe candles and<BR>\r\nallow them to burn until half gone charging and meditating on\r\nthe purpose of the spell<BR>\r\nall the while! Store the candles somewhere secure to use later\r\nwhen finishing the spell.<BR>\r\nThen place the envelope under the mattress of the &quot;ill&quot;\r\nperson or recipient of the spell if<BR>\r\npossible. You may also, if it is not possible to put it with the\r\nperson, place it behind a<BR>\r\npicture of the person in a frame; inside of a book they gave you,\r\netc., You can also<BR>\r\ninclude nail and hair clippings if you like or what you will.<BR>\r\nLet this stay undisturbed for as long as needed but it should\r\nnot exceed one full lunar cycle.<BR>\r\nWhen the magic has run it\'s course and the deed is accomplished,\r\nor when the cycle is<BR>\r\ndone light the remainder of the candles and set your circle or\r\nprepare as you did before.<BR>\r\nThen open the envelope and put everything on your altar, between\r\nthe candles in a fire<BR>\r\nproof bowl. First burn the slip of paper with the writing along\r\nwith the herbs and the hair,<BR>\r\nnails, etc., if you included them in the spell, then burn the\r\ndoll. As the doll burns it will turn<BR>\r\nfrom black to white (great sympathetic stuff here)! As you burn\r\nthese things be sure to keep<BR>\r\nfocused on the intent (such as banishing the illness, visualize\r\nthe person whole and healthy,<BR>\r\nno longer addicted, etc.) Scrape all of the ashes back into the\r\nenvelope and use some of the<BR>\r\ncandle wax to seal it up again. You can carve symbols in the wax\r\nif you like.<BR>\r\nBe sure to, get rid of everything which you used with this ritual\r\n(candle nubs, any<BR>\r\nremaining bits of herbs, the pen, etc., you should not have to\r\nget rid of the incense or oil<BR>\r\nas you should have used it anyhow). Bury or otherwise dispose\r\nof the envelope, far away<BR>\r\nfrom anyone\'s home or property.<BR>\r\n*Flash paper (the kind magicians use) is great to use for the\r\npaper, just be sure the paper is<BR>\r\nsafely in the dish before lighting it! This shows the problem\r\nproperly vanishing in a flash and<BR>\r\nthe doll burns removing the black and turning to white.<BR>\r\n**Use extreme caution with Asafoetida, just a whiff of this herb\r\nhas been known to cause<BR>\r\nvomiting, better to substitute Valerian.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">GETTING RID OF BAD HABITS<BR>\r\nTake a black candle which has been ritually cleansed and some\r\nanointing oil which has<BR>\r\nalso been ritually blessed. Do not use anything for this which\r\nhas not been cleansed or<BR>\r\nblessed already. Depending on the desired result, you should choose\r\nan oil which<BR>\r\ncorresponds to this end. At the time of the new moon, or when\r\nit first begins to wane,<BR>\r\ncast a circle or use your 9\' cord to create a sacred space.<BR>\r\nPlace the black candle (preferable a taper) on the altar with\r\nthe oil.<BR>\r\nHave no unblessed/uncleansed tools in this ritual. Cast the circle.<BR>\r\nCall the Goddess and her consort.<BR>\r\nUse a burin to engrave the candle with the spell you wish to cast.<BR>\r\nNow, anoint the candle using the oil.<BR>\r\nWhile you anoint the candle with the oil, speak these words out\r\nloud or silently<BR>\r\n&quot;Tonight no moon, tomorrow the first one. Let this be eroded\r\ntill my will be done.<BR>\r\nCandle burn down to remove all ill.<BR>\r\nLet this spell be cast by the power of my will.&quot;<BR>\r\nAnd once you have anointed the candle, place it in a safe place\r\nto it can burn down completely.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">HEALING SPIRITUAL ILLNESS<BR>\r\nA spiritual illness can be felt in a variety of ways.<BR>\r\nThere may be a feeling of being totally drained, usually a result\r\nof depression (which is<BR>\r\nan illness of the spirit as well as of the mind), there may be\r\naddictions, there may be<BR>\r\na string of bad luck, poor social relationships etc. Spiritual\r\nillness can also produce physical illness.<BR>\r\nIf it is you that is suffering from this illness, cast a circle\r\nand then visualize white light<BR>\r\nstreaming from above into you. You should be able to feel this\r\nlight like a warm wave<BR>\r\nof love. It is the love of The Goddess and of the spirits of your\r\nancestors and guardians<BR>\r\nthat you carry with you always.<BR>\r\nConcentrate on realizing that you are a Star of God sent into\r\nthis world for spiritual<BR>\r\nexperience and that the difficulties you are experiencing are\r\nonly temporary and are<BR>\r\na necessary part of your journey to spiritual enlightenment.<BR>\r\nIncantation:<BR>\r\nGreat Goddess and all you spirits of love that surround me, bring\r\nme blessings.<BR>\r\nBe with me now and forever.<BR>\r\nIf this healing is for someone else, you will of course have to\r\npersuade them to be<BR>\r\ninvolved in this-if the person is a big cynic, this can be a difficult\r\ntask, so perhaps<BR>\r\none of the other healing spells would be a better choice. But\r\nif the person is into it,<BR>\r\ncast a circle, then, as before, visualize white light streaming\r\nfrom above, into your head,<BR>\r\nand through your body. Then lay your hands (which will probably\r\nhave a slight to moderate<BR>\r\ntingling feeling) on the person and send the energy flowing into\r\nthem.<BR>\r\nIncantation:<BR>\r\nYou are filled with the white light of The God/dess.<BR>\r\nYou are a Star of God.<BR>\r\nYou are surrounded by loving spirits.<BR>\r\nGreat God/dess and all you spirits of love that surround (person\'s\r\nname), bring him/her blessings.<BR>\r\nBe with him/her, now and forever.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">FIRE ANTI ADDICTION SPELL<BR>\r\nMake an image that represents the disease, injury, condition or\r\nproblem.<BR>\r\nThis could be a poppet, an ugly thing labeled cancer, lupus, diabetes,\r\nor whatever.<BR>\r\nIt could also be a piece of paper with alcoholism, HIV, asthma\r\nor drug abuse written on it.<BR>\r\nMake the image something that represents the problem, something\r\nthat will burn.<BR>\r\nBurn this image inside a circle of white candles, invoking any\r\nwho appeal to you.<BR>\r\nIf you are making this spell on behalf of someone else, place\r\ntheir photograph or<BR>\r\nsomething else that evokes them inside the circle.

Remember that breaking bad habits\r\nis not just a magickal<BR>\r\nendeavor, but also a function of your own will and honest desire.<BR>\r\nHeavy smokers need this one...<BR>\r\nFor a portable amulet that provides extra strength in overcoming\r\na negative habit,<BR>\r\nbegin by finding a breakable representation of it.<BR>\r\nCompletely crush the token beneath your feet.<BR>\r\nAs you do, Shout &quot;______ Has no dominion over me.&quot;<BR>\r\nFeel yourself stomping that pattern out of your life.<BR>\r\nContinue until you feel drained, calm and centered.<BR>\r\nGather the remnants and mix them with pine needles and lemon rind.<BR>\r\nCautiously place this blend in a portable container.<BR>\r\nChoose a sturdy container (not cloth) so you do not accidentally\r\ncut yourself.<BR>\r\nEach time you feel tempted to slip back into old tendencies, (like\r\nsmoking) carefully<BR>\r\nsprinkle a pinch of the mixture on the ground behind you and walk\r\nfirmly away, repeat<BR>\r\nyour power phrase to reactivate the Magick.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">TO BREAK BAD HABITS<BR>\r\nWith water colors or chalk, draw or write the bad habit on a piece\r\nof paper.<BR>\r\nImmediately take it out into the rain.

Smoking, drinking the same.\r\nFor problems which<BR>\r\nutilize no concrete objects, draw a symbol or image &amp; burn.\r\nFor getting rid of things (like habits,<BR>\r\nhouseguests, etc.), I always like to add a bath element. After\r\nyour ritual, take a bath in the appropriate<BR>\r\nherbs/oil. During the bath, relax and focus on how your life will\r\nbe without X.

Seems as if our nerves <BR>\r\ncontain a chemical substance that is responsible for feeling pain\r\n(I don\'t remember the name of it).<BR>\r\nWhen you eat the hot pepper, the capsicum which is the &quot;heat&quot;\r\nin the pepper depletes the <BR>\r\nnerves of that chemical, so we feel no pain.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1"> TO BANISH ILL HEALTH FROM\r\nANOTHER<BR>\r\nThis is a very short, quick and simple spell to do. <BR>\r\nIt can be done anywhere at any time (though during the waning\r\nperiod of the <BR>\r\nmoon is best as that is the time for banishing magic). <BR>\r\nAll you need is yourself, an intent, a person in mind (it helps\r\nto have a picture of <BR>\r\nthem if it is difficult for you to visualize them) and your finger\r\n( I\'ll explain). <BR>\r\nDraw a banishing pentagram in the air with your index finger.\r\nThis is done by drawing a five <BR>\r\npointed star backwards (the opposite direction you would normally\r\ndraw it, not upside-down) <BR>\r\nDraw it while saying: <BR>\r\n   Let this pentagram banish all ill health and negativity from\r\n(the persons name). <BR>\r\nThere is no specific number of times you repeat this process,\r\nit becomes as many as you feel is enough.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1">SPIDERWEB HEALING SECRETS<BR>\r\nApply spider webs to cuts and scrapes for almost instant wound\r\nsealing. <BR>\r\nThis remedy got a trial by fire the first time I used it when\r\nI got an extremely deep cut from a <BR>\r\ncan lid and the bleeding was profuse. I grabbed a few webs from\r\noutside the door and applied <BR>\r\nthem directly to the wound, debris and all.  Then I used a butterfly\r\nbandage to hold the wound <BR>\r\nedges together after the web was applied.   This happened on a\r\nFriday evening, and by <BR>\r\nMonday the cut was sealed tight and no longer needed any bandage.\r\n<BR>\r\nThere was very little soreness and no redness, irritation or swelling.\r\n<BR>\r\nThe finger was completely usable by that Monday. <BR>\r\nThe web seems to cause clotting immediately and it hardens to\r\nform a natural scab protection <BR>\r\nthat readily peels off when wet.

I highly recommend\r\nthat you work on <BR>\r\nonly one experience at a time. If you are working on numerous\r\nexperiences with a particular <BR>\r\nindividual I suggest you work on only one experience at a time.\r\n <BR>\r\nPlease read this entire meditation through several times before\r\nbeginning. <BR>\r\nIf at any point you feel very uncomfortable during the meditation\r\nyou should not continue.<BR>\r\nIt is important that before starting that you find a quiet, comfortable\r\nplace to sit where you <BR>\r\nwill not be disturbed for at least 45 minutes. I find it helpful\r\nto take a good hot shower <BR>\r\n(not a bath!) before starting. Wear loose-fitting, comfortable\r\nclothing. It is best <BR>\r\nto wait at least three to four hours after eating before beginning.\r\n<BR>\r\nI find that this meditation is really best done in the early evening.\r\n<BR>\r\nAfter finishing you will need a good rest. <BR>\r\nYou may wish to skip dinner altogether and to have someone else\r\n(if possible) have some <BR>\r\nsoup ready for you when you are done.  It is important that after\r\nfinishing that you allow <BR>\r\nyourself at least 2 to 4 hours of rest. You will have transmuted\r\na great deal of energy and <BR>\r\nyour physical body will be tired. Also while you will have made\r\nsubstantial progress in <BR>\r\nhealing, the rest will allow you to not revisit the issue for\r\nseveral hours. <BR>\r\nWhen you awake you will notice a substantial clearing of energy\r\nin regards to your issue.  <BR>\r\nIf you follow these steps you will have released most if not all\r\nthe energy in regards to your issue. <BR>\r\nYou will always be able to go back to the experience but you will\r\nhave the strength to see it <BR>\r\nin a new light. However, once the issue is resolved I highly recommend\r\nthat you just let it go. <BR>\r\nSee it for the learning experience that it is and move on in gratitude.\r\n<BR>\r\nThis process is not about judging or blaming others. <BR>\r\nThis is a very powerful meditation and the energies at work here\r\nare very real. <BR>\r\nJudging or blaming others during this meditation will only prolong\r\nyour healing and <BR>\r\nmake it that much more difficult to release these energies in\r\nthe future.<BR>\r\nWhile sitting in your meditation place pick an issue. <BR>\r\nIt is probably best to pick a simple one until you are familiar\r\nwith the process. <BR>\r\nFor most people the first time the issue usually picks itself.<BR>\r\nIf you have a standard practice to begin your meditation that\r\nputs you in a relaxed <BR>\r\nand open place you can use this to begin. Now begin to focus on\r\nyour breathing. <BR>\r\nFollow the in and out breath without attempting to control the\r\nbreath. <BR>\r\nDo this for 8 to  10 repetitions.<BR>\r\nNext we will do a series of affirmations in conjunction with the\r\nbreath work. <BR>\r\nIt is important to focus on the energy connected with these affirmations\r\nas you are breathing. <BR>\r\nThe first part of each affirmation is the same and you will repeat\r\nthe words on the in breath. <BR>\r\nThe second part of each one is different and you will repeat it\r\non the out breath. <BR>\r\nAll three are done in order and the order is repeated each time.\r\n<BR>\r\nYou repeat the affirmations in order 1, 2, and 3 and then start\r\nat 1 again. <BR>\r\nDo the affirmations for about 15 minutes.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1">&middot;      In Breath   \r\n              Out Breath<BR>\r\n&middot;      1.

When you finish replay\r\nonly your portion of the conversation. <BR>\r\nIf you see (and you will) places where you treated the other person\r\nunfairly, were rude, <BR>\r\nor just went on a relentless attack you will want to sincerely\r\noffer an apology and ask <BR>\r\nfor forgiveness. Prepare the content of your apology and imagine\r\nplacing it inside a <BR>\r\nbeautifully wrapped package. Take this package and place it front\r\nof the person (in your mind). <BR>\r\nBow three times and each time say I am sorry. <BR>\r\nThen leave. (Again in your mind) <BR>\r\nYou are not concerned with what happens to the package or what\r\nthey do with. <BR>\r\nYou focus should be on making a sincere, no strings attached apology.\r\n</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1">7.

Now replay it again and focus on the point\r\nthe other was trying to convey. <BR>\r\nThink about how you would convey the same point. <BR>\r\nWhen they are finished thank them for sharing in the most sincere\r\nway you can. <BR>\r\nNow ask them if there is anything else they would like to say.\r\n<BR>\r\nVery often you will receive a great deal of insight into your\r\nrelationship(s) at this point. <BR>\r\nSo, Listen carefully!</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1">9.      Next you need to imagine\r\ntheir entire conversation as a whole piece. <BR>\r\nAllow the conversation to take whatever energetic form that seems\r\nappropriate. <BR>\r\nRemember you are not being attacked here but merely listening\r\nto what was <BR>\r\nexpressed without any judgment. </FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1">10.      While looking at this\r\nenergetic package begin to watch your breathing and <BR>\r\nrepeat the affirmations. When you are ready you need to allow\r\nthis package to fully <BR>\r\nenter your heart center. Continue to breath and repeat the affirmations.\r\n<BR>\r\nVery soon you will experience a deep sense of peace. <BR>\r\nWhen you do look into the eyes of the person and say:<BR>\r\n&quot;I have fully received your wondrous gift. <BR>\r\nThank you for taking the time to share your wisdom with me.&quot;<BR>\r\n&quot;I am most grateful for your gift, but it is no longer something\r\nI need.&quot;<BR>\r\nNow look deeply into your heart center, repeat the affirmations,\r\n<BR>\r\nand allow the energy you received to turn into pure love and light.\r\n<BR>\r\nNow repeat these words:<BR>\r\n&quot;I have transmuted your gift into pure love and I joyfully\r\nreturn it to you in the fullness of love and joy&quot;<BR>\r\nNow imagine that this &quot;new&quot; gift of love is flowing\r\nfrom your heart center to theirs. <BR>\r\nWhen the transfer is complete say:<BR>\r\n&quot;I am honored to have shared this learning opportunity with\r\nyou. <BR>\r\nMay all beings be blessed by the love we have shared today.&quot;<BR>\r\nThank them again and return to your heart center. <BR>\r\nFocus on your breathing and begin the affirmations again.

You can also burn your favorite incense to\r\nhelp you relax.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1">MAGICKAL HEALING MASSAGE<BR>\r\nMassage is one of the single most important therapies used in\r\nhealing. <BR>\r\nThe visualization of chi, or \'life force,&quot; being manipulated\r\nis a valid method for moving healing <BR>\r\nenergies through the body. This life force is thought to originate\r\nin the spine with its movement <BR>\r\ngoing either down the legs and out through the toes, or up the\r\nback and along the arms and <BR>\r\nthen out through the fingers. In all techniques of massage that\r\nuse visualization of chi there <BR>\r\nare some very basic rules: <BR>\r\n1. Once you begin to touch the body, the movement should always\r\nbe away from the spine, <BR>\r\neither up the body and out through the fingers or down the legs\r\nand out through the toes. <BR>\r\nIf you begin to massage the neck, then you must visualize that\r\nenergy moving out through <BR>\r\nthe arms and then the fingers. You should not make any movement\r\ndown the back. <BR>\r\nThe flow and direction of chi are very important.<BR>\r\n2. Keep at least one hand on your partner\'s body (if you are reaching\r\nfor oil, for example). <BR>\r\nOnce you begin touching the body, you should continue that movement\r\nuntil the energy is <BR>\r\nbrought out through the feet or the hands. <BR>\r\n3. Eventually your hands will become tired and cramped. <BR>\r\nAccording to conventional medical wisdom, you have strained them\r\nfrom overuse. <BR>\r\nChinese practitioners believed however, that when this happens\r\nyou have simply taken the <BR>\r\nnervous energy from your partner and brought it into your own\r\naura. <BR>\r\nTheir technique is to shake both hands, snapping the excess nervous\r\nenergy off into space. It works. <BR>\r\nYou relieve your cramps and your partner feels a definite loss\r\nof nerves<BR>\r\n4. The more you are able to visualize the movement of this energy,\r\nchi, the more vibrant the <BR>\r\nexperience of massage is to your partner. She or he will literally\r\nfeel the energy! <BR>\r\n5. Foot and ear massages are more important than neck and back\r\nmassages. <BR>\r\nThere are more meridian points in the ear than most of the rest\r\nof the body combined. <BR>\r\nThe ear symbolizes the body in a fetal position. <BR>\r\nThe foot also symbolizes the entire body as well, and by learning\r\nreflexology you can <BR>\r\nenhance the healing of internal parts of the body through correct\r\nmassage of the feet.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1">A CURE FOR THE COMMON COLD<BR>\r\nThere is a cure for the common cold! Take some ascorbic acid powder\r\n(vitamin C crystals), <BR>\r\nmix a teaspoon in juice and take hourly until you almost get diarrhea\r\n(tolerance). <BR>\r\nStop taking it until the tolerance improves then restart the vitamin\r\nC, should be used at <BR>\r\nthe first sign of a cold, the flu, and allergic reaction of any\r\ninfection. <BR>\r\nRepeat until your symptoms of infection are gone. <BR>\r\nThis simple therapy works because vitamin C in mega doses acts\r\nvery much like an antihistamine, <BR>\r\nmobilizes your white cells and antibodies and, in general, clears\r\nout toxins from your body.<BR>\r\nColds and flu\'s are also blunted by supplements of zinc gluconate\r\nlozenges. <BR>\r\nOther natural remedies for flu symptoms include garlic, bioflavinoids,\r\nLactobacillus <BR>\r\nacidophilus (found in yogurt), cod or halibut liver oil, propolis\r\nand Echinacea. <BR>\r\nThese may be used as an alternative for those who have trouble\r\ntaking either <BR>\r\nvitamin C or zinc in larger than RDA doses.<BR>\r\nOne study in adults showed that taking about 10 zinc lozenges\r\n(containing 23 mg of zinc) <BR>\r\nper day reduced the length of recovery from the common cold from\r\nan average of 10.8 days to 3.9 days.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1">HEALING WITH HONEY: <BR>\r\nWhen you select honey for medicinal use, always buy a variety\r\nthat is produced by an <BR>\r\napiary local to your area.

The honey should be raw, not heated or processed.\r\n</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1">HONEY FLU REMEDY: <BR>\r\nTake a six-inch ginger root and slice it.

When you use external treatments to attain\r\nwellness, you are <BR>\r\nactivating natural, inner resources that normally serve to make\r\nyou well without any <BR>\r\noutside help at all. The body can magically heal itself, provided\r\nyou know what to do to <BR>\r\nkeep it running at maximum efficiency. Hygeian healing uses preventive\r\nmeasures to <BR>\r\nenhance internal resistance to disease. <BR>\r\nYou can promote healing by getting appropriate exercise and rest,\r\nholding good thoughts <BR>\r\nand mental images, fostering positive spiritual beliefs and practices,\r\nand eating less fat <BR>\r\nand protein and more grains, fresh fruits, and veggies. Hygeian\r\ntonics are especially <BR>\r\neffective for enhancing and toning the natural healing system\r\nand neutralizing harmful <BR>\r\ninfluences in the body. </FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1">GARLIC lowers blood pressure\r\nand cholesterol, is a powerful antiseptic tic, <BR>\r\nantibiotic, and anticancer agent, and protects liver and brain\r\ncells. <BR>\r\nAdd fresh garlic in any form to your food daily. <BR>\r\nGINGER, known in ancient China and India, tones, uplifts, and\r\nwarms the <BR>\r\nsystem, stimulates digestion and circulation, calms upset stomach,\r\nand relieves <BR>\r\nnausea, aches, and pains. Ginger can be eaten in candied slices,\r\nhoney-based <BR>\r\nsyrups, encapsulated, or drunk as a tea. <BR>\r\nGREEN TEA, the national beverage of Japan, protects the body against\r\nheart <BR>\r\ndisease and cancer. It offers a benign form of caffeine along\r\nwith great benefits <BR>\r\nas a general tonic. Try green tea instead of the usual coffee,\r\nblack tea, or cola <BR>\r\nfor a healthy pick-me-up. <BR>\r\nMILK THISTLE, an old European folk remedy, detoxifies and enhances\r\nliver function. <BR>\r\nAlcohol, pharmaceutical and/or recreational drug users or those\r\nwho have suffered <BR>\r\nexposure to toxic substances should take this herb regularly.\r\n<BR>\r\nASTRACALUS is a popular Chinese herb used to treat colds, flu,\r\nand chronic infections <BR>\r\nsuch as bronchitis, sinusitis, and AIDS. It restores immunity,\r\nand increases vitality and <BR>\r\nresistance to disease. Take encapsulated astragalus if you lack\r\nenergy or feel stressed. <BR>\r\nGINSENG, usually recommended for men, is stimulating, sexually\r\nenergizing, can improve <BR>\r\nthe appetite, aid digestion, tone the skin and muscles, and balance\r\nhormones in women. <BR>\r\nIt is a great rejuvenator for the tired, the elderly, and the\r\nchronically ill. Ginseng comes in <BR>\r\ncandies, teas, wines, and elixirs. <BR>\r\nDONG QUAI is a Chinese herb, used predominantly by women to build\r\nblood, increase <BR>\r\ncirculation, and regulate menstrual and reproductive disorders.\r\nTry dong quai in tincture <BR>\r\nor capsule form to restore balance. <BR>\r\nMAITAKE MUSHROOMS are highly esteemed for their healing properties.\r\n<BR>\r\nAdd maitake tablets or capsules to your diet to protect your body\r\nagainst cancer, <BR>\r\nAIDS, chronic fatigue, hepatitis, allergies, environmental illness.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1">HEALING BY THE MOON<BR>\r\nThe waxing phase of the Moon is the best time to build the body\r\nup. <BR>\r\nThis is when I use nurturing herbs and tonics to strengthen the\r\nbody\'s natural immunities. <BR>\r\nRaspberry leaf is an excellent tonic for female reproductive organs;\r\nhawthorn berries are <BR>\r\ngood for the cardiovascular system; nettle is a great blood tonic;\r\nmarshmallow root is a <BR>\r\nsoothing tonic for the urinary tract; astragalas is a wonderful\r\nimmune system tonic; <BR>\r\nburdock is a good liver tonic; red clover builds fertility; oat\r\nstraw is good for the nervous <BR>\r\nsystem; and alfalfa is a fantastic all-around nutritive tonic.\r\n<BR>\r\nThese herbs are simple and gentle. They are best taken in a cup\r\nof tea, three to five times a day. <BR>\r\nDuring the waxing phase I also like to increase water intake to\r\navoid water retention. <BR>\r\nThe more water we ingest, the less water our bodies attempt to\r\nretain. <BR>\r\nThis is also a good time to apply medicinal salves and to take\r\ntherapeutic baths. <BR>\r\nMost importantly, I work during the waxing Moon to ensure that\r\nthe body has all the <BR>\r\nnutritional support it needs. This is the body\'s building time,\r\nand it needs a good supply <BR>\r\nof minerals, vitamins, carbohydrates, lipids, and amino acids\r\nto be healthy. <BR>\r\nI would also not attempt to fast or to lose weight during the\r\nwaxing Moon. <BR>\r\nUse energy healing techniques to strengthen and reconnect with\r\nthe earth. <BR>\r\nBe careful to ground and center when healing so that you never\r\nuse up your own life force energy. <BR>\r\nThe universe is full of energy to use, and by tapping into it\r\nyou will be able to help many more <BR>\r\npeople than you could by using just your energy alone. <BR>\r\n  FULL MOON <BR>\r\nThe Full Moon lasts about three days. It is a very intense phase.\r\nMany women still ovulate with the <BR>\r\nFull Moon. This is the time to apply the most powerful herbs.\r\n  Use cayenne capsules to <BR>\r\ntreat infections of any kind. Goldenseal is a well-known herbal\r\nantibiotic. Echinacea and lomatium <BR>\r\nare anti-viral.  Dong quai is an excellent herb for female hormonal\r\nfluctuations. <BR>\r\nEnergy healing work during the Full Moon is very powerful.  On\r\nthe energetic level, it acts like a<BR>\r\nmagnifying mirror. The strong lunar energy pulls everything out\r\nof hiding and reflects it back at us. <BR>\r\nThis is often the time during an acute illness when people feel\r\ntheir worst. The Full Moon intensifies <BR>\r\nwhatever else is going on. Often people aren\'t even aware that\r\nthey\'re sick until the Full Moon hits. <BR>\r\nThis is also an excellent time for psychological therapy.  Emotions\r\nseem closer to the surface than <BR>\r\nusual and social inhibitions melt away.  Agendas that have been\r\nsimmering under the surface tend <BR>\r\nto come out under the light of the Full Moon. This is a time to\r\nstrengthen relationships and reaffirm <BR>\r\nbonds. Never underestimate the healing power of simply holding\r\nsomeone\'s hand and listening. <BR>\r\nThis is not the time for isolation or introspection . The Full\r\nMoon draws all of life toward it. <BR>\r\nEven the solid ground rises several inches when the Full Moon\r\npasses overhead! <BR>\r\n  WANING MOON <BR>\r\nThe waning Moon is the best time to employ therapeutic fasts.\r\n Avoid drastic fasting. <BR>\r\nThere is usually no need to starve the body to heal it. However,\r\nit may be helpful to limit <BR>\r\nyour intake to juices and soups for a few days during the waning\r\nMoon, particularly when <BR>\r\nstruggling with the flu.  Use purifying herbs in moderation at\r\nthis time. Sage, <BR>\r\nusnea, ginger, lemon, thyme, lavender, and peppermint are all\r\ncleansing and clearing herbs. <BR>\r\nThe waning Moon is also a good time to do sweats and diaphoretic\r\n(sweat producing) baths. <BR>\r\nIn addition, if you are trying to kick a habit, do it during the\r\nwaning phase. <BR>\r\nUse energy healing techniques to sever unhealthy bonds and strengthen\r\nboundaries. <BR>\r\n  NEW MOON <BR>\r\nThe New Moon is as powerful in its own way as the Full Moon. \r\nIt is a time for taking stock. <BR>\r\nIt is a phase of hibernation, retreat, and contemplation.  Avoid\r\ncrowds and gatherings and <BR>\r\nseek a little time for yourself.    Rest is crucial during the\r\nNew Moon. <BR>\r\nSimple foods and quiet times are powerful healers. Many women\r\nmenstruate with the New Moon. <BR>\r\nIt is natural to want to curl up in bed with a good book and nice\r\ncup of chamomile tea. <BR>\r\nStronger nervines (relaxing herbs) are skullcap, hops, catnip,\r\noatstraw, and valerian. <BR>\r\nAfter the New Moon ends and that first crescent appears, then\r\nthe healing lunar cycle <BR>\r\nbegins all over again.  Most acute diseases do not last a full\r\nlunar cycle. <BR>\r\nThe information in this article is only intended to be an educational\r\ntool, not a prescription. <BR>\r\nIt is always wise to consult with your health care provider when\r\nexperiencing any illness or discomfort. <BR>\r\nAwareness of the rhythms of nature can assist you and your health\r\ncare provider in <BR>\r\ndetermining the best course of treatment at any given time.  Naturally,\r\nsome conditions <BR>\r\nwill require that you apply therapies that don\'t necessarily &quot;fit&quot;\r\nwith the phase of the Moon.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1">A SPELL OF HEALING<BR>\r\nPrepare the space which you use as an altar by placing a white\r\ncandle, <BR>\r\na piece of paper, an ink pen, a quartz crystal, something which\r\ncould represent <BR>\r\na cauldron (I used a mortar from a pestle and mortar in the kitchen)\r\nand some oil - <BR>\r\nI used frankincense but that is horribly expensive, I got it as\r\na present and only use it very occasionally.<BR>\r\nCast the circle in whichever way you see fit. I normally start\r\nat the east and use the <BR>\r\nvisualization techniques suggested - tracing a pentacle of blue\r\nfire in the air at each <BR>\r\ncorner and visualizing its element - so at the east visualize\r\na wide open plain with <BR>\r\nwind rushing across it, at the south feel the sun beat down on\r\nyou and fill you with <BR>\r\ngreat warmth, at the west imagine yourself standing atop a cliff\r\noverlooking a wide, <BR>\r\ndeep ocean, and at the north picture yourself standing at the\r\nfoot of great mountains <BR>\r\ncloaked in dark forests. Then collect yourself, focus your mind\r\nand go back to your altar. <BR>\r\nAt the altar, set your mind clearly to what you intend to do.\r\nThen light the candle, saying<BR>\r\n&quot;I dedicate this candle to thee, Lord Apollo the Physician,\r\nand ask your aiding in fighting this illness.&quot;<BR>\r\nBreathe deeply for a while, feeling the power within the circle\r\npool inside you, and when <BR>\r\nyou feel ready, find a word which most typifies the illness for\r\nyou - it could be its name <BR>\r\n(I chose &quot;meningitis&quot;), it could be the way it makes\r\nyou feel (&quot;misery&quot; for example) - <BR>\r\neither way it has to represent the illness for you. Now, write\r\nthe word on the piece of <BR>\r\npaper, and as you do it say &quot;I imbue thee, paper, with the\r\nessence of this illness - thou <BR>\r\nshalt represent it for me in this ritual.&quot; Put the paper\r\ndown, and then douse it with the oil, saying <BR>\r\n&quot;With this oil I prepare thee, .&quot; <BR>\r\nHold the paper to the flame and set light to it. Be careful! <BR>\r\nOil soaked paper burns A LOT faster than you expect it to. Drop\r\nit into the cauldron, saying <BR>\r\n&quot;With fire I vanquish thee, , in the name of Apollo the Physician\r\nI destroy thee, &quot; <BR>\r\nRepeat this phrase three times. Finally, center yourself again\r\nand hold the quartz crystal to your third eye. <BR>\r\nBreathe deeply and use the crystal as a resonator for the energy\r\naround you. <BR>\r\nIf you are healing yourself, let the energy from the ritual which\r\nis  inside the circle focus in the <BR>\r\ncrystal and enter you, healing you and making you healthy and\r\nstrong. If you are healing <BR>\r\nsomeone else, use the crystal to focus the energy of the ritual\r\nagain but this time use it like <BR>\r\na transmitter, sending the energy out along a shining path to\r\nheal your loved one. <BR>\r\nWhen this is done, thank Apollo for his presence - I said <BR>\r\n&quot;I thank thee, Lord Apollo, for your presence here tonight\r\n- farewell, Lord!&quot;. <BR>\r\nThen close the circle by thanking each of the directions, starting\r\nat north and ending at <BR>\r\neast, and ground the energy - I always do this by reciting<BR>\r\n&quot;Circle open but unbroken, power down to the ground,&quot;\r\n<BR>\r\nand pound my staff or stamp on the floor three times to let the\r\nenergy flow out of me <BR>\r\nback into the earth. You can leave the candle burning as long\r\nas you like - perhaps <BR>\r\nuntil you get a sign that you or the sufferer is improving might\r\nbe a nice idea.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1">HEALING<BR>\r\n A technique for rapid healing from injuries that often is effective\r\nis to go back in your  mind to the <BR>\r\nmoment of the accident and visualize as clearly and nearly as\r\npossible the  exact event except <BR>\r\nchange a detail /details so that the accident, injury, trauma\r\n, does not  happen you are not in any <BR>\r\nway hurt, repeat the visualization over and over make it as real\r\n as possible ,if it is practical to act <BR>\r\nout the event as closely as possible in the physical world  -\r\nas almost slamming the door on your <BR>\r\nhand that can make this even more effective. If you  are in pain\r\nand the pain is reduced then its <BR>\r\nok to drop the visualization but keep  reinforcing this vision\r\n. Theoretically this is more effective if <BR>\r\ndone soon after an injury but I have used it on injuries and traumatic\r\nexperiences from years <BR>\r\nback with good results.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-1">STONE OF LUCK<BR>\r\nYou can use the Stone of Luck spell for anything, love, money,\r\nhealth, wealth, spirit awareness, etc. <BR>\r\nThe key to this empowerment is concentration and belief. <BR>\r\nWhen you have completed this spell, carry the stone around with\r\nyou. <BR>\r\nEventually you will start to get what you want. <BR>\r\nWhat you need:<BR>\r\n   1 Small stone of your choice (any kind)   1 candle (correct\r\ncolor for what you want)<BR>\r\n   Appropriate herbs   Appropriate incense  Salt   Water   A cloth\r\n  <BR>\r\n   Oil (either olive, jasmine, or mint)   Some bowls (glass or\r\ncrystal) <BR>\r\nFirst you need to meditate on what you want, be it money, love,\r\nbetter health....whatever you want. <BR>\r\nAfter you feel you have meditated long enough, you may start the\r\nspell.<BR>\r\nLight the candle and incense.

This is usually best\r\nperformed on a waning moon, <BR>\r\nwhen it is almost new moon.  You cannot perform this ritual on\r\nsomeone else without them <BR>\r\nbeing present.  You can, however, guide the person who needs healing\r\nto do this ritual on <BR>\r\ntheir own.  It is only effective if the person with the ailment\r\nperforms it, so it is ideal to heal yourself.<BR>\r\nYour primary ritual tool will be an element.  Choose one from\r\nthe list that is most appropriate <BR>\r\nfor whatever area of the body you will be healing:<BR>\r\nAbdomen: Fire Arms: Earth Blood: Air Bones: Earth Chest: Air <BR>\r\nEars: Water Eyes: Water Feet: Earth Genitalia: Fire Hands: Earth\r\n<BR>\r\nHeart: Fire Legs: Earth Lungs: Air Mind: Fire Nose: Air Skin:\r\nEarth <BR>\r\nStomach: Water Teeth: Earth Throat: Air Uterus: Water <BR>\r\nYou should prepare for the ritual with a ritual bath.  Once you\r\nare ready, you can go to your <BR>\r\nmagickal place and get ready.  Your working area should be equipped\r\nwith whatever is needed<BR>\r\nto invite the element of choice into the magick.  You can use\r\nany method you want to have <BR>\r\nthe element present, but if you need ideas, here is some help:<BR>\r\nEarth: Stones, crystals, a dish of earth, or salt. <BR>\r\nFire: Candles or a small bonfire (be careful and keep a bucket\r\nof water handy for emergencies!). <BR>\r\nAir: Incense <BR>\r\nWater: A dish of water will suffice, but if you can perform the\r\nritual near a body of water like <BR>\r\na river or lake that would be ideal.  You only need to have the\r\nelement pertinent to your ritual at hand. <BR>\r\nHowever, if you want to invite all the elements, that is fine\r\ntoo.  Just keep the focus on the one vital healing <BR>\r\nelement.   You should dress is all white if at all possible.<BR>\r\nCast your circle around your entire prepared ritual area. <BR>\r\nSit in the center with your element before you. Inhale and exhale\r\ndeeply and slowly <BR>\r\nto reach a meditative state. With your eyes closed, envision a\r\npure white light surrounding you. <BR>\r\nNow that you have entered your magical state, take the element\r\ninto your hands <BR>\r\n(if it is water, hold it in a container; if it is fire, hold the\r\ncandle; if it is air, hold the incense stick, etc.). <BR>\r\nFeel the energy of the element flowing through you. Hold the element\r\nover the general area <BR>\r\nthat needs healing and envision the energy flowing into that area.\r\nSee it being healed. <BR>\r\nContinue to allow the elemental energy to flow into the area until\r\na feeling of peace comes over you. <BR>\r\nIt is done! Close the circle and return the element to nature.<BR>\r\n(Note: Do not blow a candle out! Pinch it or extinguish it with\r\na bit of water.) <BR>\r\nHave an after-ritual meal of cakes and wine (or bread and juice).<BR>\r\nThis ritual will begin doings its work immediately, but it will\r\nnot cure anything instantly. <BR>\r\nAllow it a good amount of time, a week for a minor ailment, a\r\nmonth for a major illness. <BR>\r\nIf you are using any medications or supplements for your illness,\r\nit helps to have those <BR>\r\npresent during the ritual.   They will be charged with magickal\r\nenergy so that when you take them <BR>\r\nthey will be doing twice the good!</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">RELEASE OF PAIN INCANTATION/RITUAL <BR>\r\nThis is to be done on a rainy night outdoors. <BR>\r\nStand in the rain and let it touch you - do not wear heavy clothing\r\nto protect yourself from it. <BR>\r\nCall the rain and draw it down harder. Cast no circle, lest the\r\npain stay trapped within it. <BR>\r\nWhen the downpour becomes heavy, begin.

Build all the energy here until you can contain\r\nit no more. <BR>\r\nWhen you can no longer contain the energy in your heart, release\r\nthe energy to flood <BR>\r\nyour entire body, and shout as loud as you can &quot;HEAL ME!!!&quot;\r\nat the same time as the release. <BR>\r\nContinue to draw the energy for a while, letting it flow through\r\nyour body, and spilling onto <BR>\r\nthe ground. Relax, and enjoy the peace that will settle over you.\r\n<BR>\r\nAfter you have relaxed for a while, draw up your roots into your\r\nbody, remove your hands <BR>\r\nfrom the water, and sit up. Take a sip from the bowl to your left,\r\nand thank the God for his <BR>\r\nlove, then spill it at the base of a tree.

Such as, if the <BR>\r\nspell is to heal an illness you might simply write whatever that\r\nillness is, in example: <BR>\r\n&quot;cold/flu.&quot; You might also write it over the appropriate\r\nbody part, such as if it is a head <BR>\r\ncold write it on the head.

Be sure <BR>\r\nyour back and body are as relaxed as possible. <BR>\r\nHold this muscle contraction while taking ten deep breaths. <BR>\r\nMove the energy from this area up and out the top of the head.<BR>\r\nTechnique: <BR>\r\nGradually do this exercise until you can hold the contraction\r\nfor twenty breaths. <BR>\r\nThis will release excess Kundalini from these areas, helping it\r\non its way up the spine.<BR>\r\nIt also helps conquer emotional states. <BR>\r\nTo break out of a sluggish cycle, perform the belly contraction\r\nexercise once each day, <BR>\r\nuntil the area feels cleansed. In the future, perform the exercise\r\nas the need arises. <BR>\r\nBegin by stating your intention for this body process. Visualize\r\nyourself surrounded in a <BR>\r\nsoft healing light. Close your eyes and breathe fully into the\r\nbottom of your belly. <BR>\r\nFollow the movement of your breath in and out of your body for\r\na moment. <BR>\r\nLet each exhalation take you deeper into your body. <BR>\r\nSettle into your body as you feel the rising and falling of your\r\nabdomen with your breath. <BR>\r\nKnow that any thoughts or cares from your day can drift out of\r\nyour mind with each exhalation. <BR>\r\nImagine that, just like a tree, you are sending roots down deep\r\ninto the ground. <BR>\r\nWhen you\'re ready, scan through your body. Notice any area that\r\nseems to draw your attention <BR>\r\nin some way, perhaps a place in your body that feels tense and\r\nconstricted or where breath and <BR>\r\nenergy aren\'t moving as freely as possible. Fully focus your awareness\r\non this place in your body. <BR>\r\nNotice what you feel and experience as you do this. Focus on the\r\nquality of the sensations. <BR>\r\nThis body experience may have a color, shape, temperature, or\r\ntexture. If it had a form, <BR>\r\nwhat would it look like? Notice what emotional feelings are evoked\r\nas these things emerge. <BR>\r\nPerhaps, it is a familiar feeling in some way or reminds you of\r\nsomething. <BR>\r\nLet any form have a voice. If, rather than expressing yourself\r\nthrough sensation and pain, this <BR>\r\nbody experience could speak, what would it tell you? You may also\r\nhave something to reply, <BR>\r\na response or question. As you give full expression to the feelings\r\nthat emerge, it will help <BR>\r\nyou to release any blocked emotional energy which has been held\r\nin your body. <BR>\r\nHave a sense that this energy can just drain out of your body\r\ndown into the earth through the <BR>\r\nroots you visualized earlier. Also, there may be a sound or movement\r\nthat you/your body <BR>\r\nwould like to make in response to these feelings. If so, let yourself\r\nexpress the sound and let <BR>\r\nyour body move in any way which would feel good. Use pillows as\r\nprops if you need to. <BR>\r\nWhen this feels complete, visualize a healing, loving light that\r\nenfolds you and fills your <BR>\r\nwhole body. Perhaps it has a color. Allow you body to absorb this\r\nloving light and drink it in. <BR>\r\nTake some time to immerse yourself in it. Breathe in the love\r\nand let it fill every structure, organ, <BR>\r\nand tissue of your body, particularly any specific areas upon\r\nwhich you\'ve focused. Feel every <BR>\r\ncell bathed, soothed, and nourished with this healing light. After\r\ncompleting this exploration, <BR>\r\nallow yourself to return to external awareness as you would after\r\na traditional meditation.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">HEALING SPELL<BR>\r\nSaffron green cotton square of cloth (8&quot;) Can be a print,\r\nbut predominantly a healthy green color. <BR>\r\nAn herb that is healing for your friend\'s ailment.

Close\r\nthe circle by visualizing it as <BR>\r\ndissipating into the floor in your usual way.<BR>\r\nLet the red candle burn out if you desire.

Grind some nutmeg\r\nand mix it into <BR>\r\nthe wax as you prepare the candle. Add some vanilla extract to\r\nthe wax for smell. <BR>\r\nLight the candle and let the fumes fill your house. <BR>\r\nThis works well against the flu and the dreaded cold. <BR>\r\nIf you combine this with some jewel therapy remember that sapphire\r\nis a general <BR>\r\nenchanter and that agate is said to reduce fever. <BR>\r\nTO MAKE A CANDLE:<BR>\r\nFirst you will need to buy a sheet of wax from a craft or hobby\r\nstore. <BR>\r\nCut it into several chunks and fill a coffee can roughly half\r\nfull with it. <BR>\r\nPlace the can in a pot that has water in it. The water level should\r\nnot be higher than the <BR>\r\ncan because sometimes water will spill or boil over. Heat the\r\npot of water and when the <BR>\r\nwax has turned into a fairly clear liquid, use a pair of tongs\r\nto pour it into a frame. <BR>\r\nSome people make their own frames out of sheet metal. Keep the\r\nframe upside down <BR>\r\nand suspend a wick with an extended rod, letting the wick hang\r\ndown with a little extra <BR>\r\nat the end to light. It\'s okay to use empty tuna fish cans to\r\ncreate votives and feel free to <BR>\r\nexperiment with other designs.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">WAX IMAGE HEALING SPELL<BR>\r\nIngredients: A wax doll (in Red for strength or Green for regeneration).<BR>\r\nYou can buy these at occult shops or make one yourself.<BR>\r\nTry to make the image look as much like the person in need of\r\nhealing as possible. <BR>\r\nOf course, unless you are a budding Rodin, it\'s not going to look\r\na hell of a lot like the <BR>\r\nperson but it must be anatomically correct and look enough like\r\nthe person that your <BR>\r\nvisualization will be strong and intense. This is critical because\r\nthe point of this exercise <BR>\r\nis to identify this image with the person. If you can obtain some\r\nhair or nail parings or an <BR>\r\nobject or objects that the person has touched, that can help a\r\ngreat deal in identifying <BR>\r\nthe doll as the person. When you have prepared the doll, cast\r\nthe circle. Take the doll <BR>\r\ngently in your hands. Every step of the way remember that for\r\nthe purposes of this spell <BR>\r\nthe doll is the person in need of healing so treat it gently and\r\nrespectfully. <BR>\r\nCradle the doll in your hands and say <BR>\r\nI name you (person\'s name) with the blessings of The Sun and The\r\nMoon. <BR>\r\nEnvision yourself filled with the white-golden light that pervades\r\nthe Universe. <BR>\r\nVisualize it flowing through you and into the doll (which is the\r\nsick person\'s stand-in). <BR>\r\nVisualize this person absorbing light and healing energy from\r\nyour hands. <BR>\r\nVisualize them filled with well-being of body and mind, drawing\r\npower from The Sun, The Moon, <BR>\r\nThe Earth. Use this intense to fill them with the stamina and\r\nstrength to overcome this illness. <BR>\r\nSustain the visualization until the time feels right and then\r\nincant: <BR>\r\nWith this spell, I have bathed (person\'s name) in the light of\r\nThe Sun and The Moon. <BR>\r\n(Person\'s name) is bathed in healing. <BR>\r\nHealing is working in (person\'s name\'s) body and every cell in\r\nhis/her body is <BR>\r\nstrengthened and revitalized and all illness is carried away from\r\nhim/her. So mote it be! <BR>\r\nNow take the doll and lovingly bind it with string. <BR>\r\nSay, (person\'s name) I wrap you up in health. <BR>\r\nThen gently wrap the doll up in the cloth and put it away in a\r\nsafe place where you are <BR>\r\nsure it will not be disturbed. Once the spell has worked, it is\r\nessential that you dispose of <BR>\r\nthis wax image in the correct way. This can be done by taking\r\nit to a body of water, then <BR>\r\nunwrapping it from the string and clothe and then saying:<BR>\r\nThis is no longer (person\'s name). It is now merely a thing of\r\nwax. <BR>\r\nThen break it into pieces and throw each piece into the water.<BR>\r\nIncantation: Return to the elements from whence you came.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">HEALING FOR SOMEONE IN YOUR FAMILY<BR>\r\nPrepare an envelope from a square of paper that you have folded\r\n- <BR>\r\nIf you do not know how to do this, you can use a very small letter\r\nenvelope. <BR>\r\nOn the envelope write the word &quot;Health&quot;.

If it\'s\r\ntoo oily, add another few <BR>\r\nshavings of beeswax. At this point, you can add a natural preservative\r\nto your balm to <BR>\r\nprevent spoilage. Vitamin E, squeezed from capsules, works very\r\nwell. <BR>\r\nRosemary extracts or oil might improve the aroma and antiseptic\r\nproperties as well. <BR>\r\nYou\'ll need about 1/4 tsp. (two capsules) to preserve this much\r\nbalm. <BR>\r\nAfter you\'ve blended in the vitamin E, transfer your final product\r\nto a sterile glass jar.<BR>\r\nUse a clean spoon or small spatula to transfer the balm to avoid\r\nintroducing bacteria to the jar.<BR>\r\nHow to use it: Apply the balm to rashes, scrapes, and other small\r\nor superficial abrasions <BR>\r\n(don\'t use it on deep cuts). You can also apply it regularly to\r\nhelp heal chronically chapped skin. <BR>\r\nStored in a cool, dark place, the balm should keep for up to a\r\nyear. Discard if it smells rancid.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">BUBBLE HEALING SPELL <BR>\r\nPrep work: 5 small bowls Incense [burn spearmint and allspice\r\non charcoal] <BR>\r\nBubbles and bubble wand Food coloring: green, blue, red, yellow<BR>\r\n[Mix each color of food coloring in each bowl with a portion of\r\nthe bubble solution, <BR>\r\nand in the 5th bowl add a small portion of each color to a portion\r\nof the bubble solution] <BR>\r\nCleanse your sacred area, cast the circle, call the Quarters,\r\ninvoke the God and The Goddess, <BR>\r\nand light the incense.

Melt this\r\nslowly in a double <BR>\r\nboiler, or in a pan over boiling water, and mix the shavings with\r\na bit of water so they <BR>\r\ndon\'t stick together in the pan. When you have a nice, smooth\r\nconsistency to work <BR>\r\nwith, you can add empowered ingredients. Good ingredients to add\r\nwould be:<BR>\r\n-money herbs and oils, such as patchouli, mint, basil, cinquefoil,\r\nginger, sage, <BR>\r\nTonka, nutmeg, oak moss and lemon balm.<BR>\r\n-empowered gold glitter <BR>\r\n-Green vegetable coloring (or whatever color you correspond money\r\nand prosperity with)<BR>\r\nOnce you have added your ingredients, let the mixture cool slightly\r\nuntil you can start <BR>\r\nforming it in your hands. You can now roll it into balls, wrap\r\nthem up in some <BR>\r\ncheesecloth or muslin, and let them harden. <BR>\r\nAn easier way to make a quick money soap is to purchase some melt\r\n&amp; pour glycerin from <BR>\r\na craft store - I think they even have it at Wal-Mart. It\'s sold\r\nin blocks. Melt the blocks in <BR>\r\nglassware over the stove or on the microwave until it is liquid.\r\n<BR>\r\nAdd your empowered ingredients quickly, as melt &amp; pour sets\r\nfast. <BR>\r\nNext, pour the mixture into a mold (these can be purchased also,\r\nor you can make <BR>\r\nmolds from just about anything from margarine tubs to juice cans\r\nto empty toilet paper <BR>\r\nrolls with foil on one end) and let the soap set. <BR>\r\nMelt and pour soap is easier to work with, because you can add\r\nyour ingredients much <BR>\r\neasier, and you don\'t end up with so much soap afterwards. You\r\ncan also make bars <BR>\r\nthat are individual to your needs. For example, try pouring half\r\nthe mixture into the mold, <BR>\r\nadd a toy coin or a plastic dollar sign which you have empowered,\r\nthen pour the rest into the mold. <BR>\r\nWhen hardened, you will have a soap with an empowered item in\r\nthe middle of it. <BR>\r\nYou could even put a charged stone in the middle of the soap.<BR>\r\nCreating the soap with your individuality only makes it more powerful.<BR>\r\nThe best part? The above directions can be used for any magickal\r\ngoal, not just money! <BR>\r\nOne more thing, when using your soap, concentrate clearly on your\r\nintentions and visualize! <BR>\r\nFor money, visualize the soap attracting the money to you. <BR>\r\nFor illness, visualize the soap cleaning the illness out of you.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">9/9/01</FONT>\r\n\r\n</BODY>',

No wonder, then, the herbs that correspond with your\r\nsign<BR>\r\nare also a bit &quot;hot&quot; to the taste. Use them in cooking\r\nto raise your<BR>\r\nendorphins, the substance Mars loves best.<BR>\r\nTaurus - Venus<BR>\r\nApple, apricot, blackberry, cherry, heather, hibiscus, raspberry,\r\nrose.<BR>\r\nTaurus is the sign that\'s fondest of the pleasures that life inside<BR>\r\nthese bodies can provide.

It makes perfect sense, then, that the bright, cheerful<BR>\r\nsunflower would be the perfect representation of your equally\r\nbright<BR>\r\nand happy sign. Herbs like goldenseal and St. John\'s Wort are\r\ntailor-made<BR>\r\nfor you, too, since their ability to keep the body resistant to\r\nillness<BR>\r\nand depression are well known.

Since<BR>\r\ncommunication (and mass communication in particular) is your specialty,<BR>\r\nthe herbs above are all associated with the air principle, which\r\nrules<BR>\r\nthe intellectual side of life. To increase your already powerful<BR>\r\nintuition, use citron, clover, or rosemary. Above all else, listen\r\nto<BR>\r\nthat intuition.

To make a decoction use 1 ounce\r\nof dried herbs to 1<BR>\r\npint of water that has been brought to a boil. Keep water just\r\nbelow boiling for about 30<BR>\r\nminutes and let herbs simmer. Simmering may take up to 1 hour,\r\ndepending on plant used.<BR>\r\nA higher heat than infusions is necessary because of the toughness\r\nof the plant parts.<BR>\r\nDecoctions should always be strained while hot, so that the matter\r\nthat separates on<BR>\r\ncooling may be mixed again with the fluid by shaking when the\r\nremedy is used.<BR>\r\nUse glass, ceramic or earthenware pots, or clean, unbroken enameled\r\ncast iron.<BR>\r\nDo not use plain cast iron with astringent plants.<BR>\r\nElectuary<BR>\r\nWhen powders are mixed with syrup, honey, brown sugar, or glycerin\r\nto produce a more<BR>\r\npleasant taste or to make them easier to use internally, they\r\nare called electuarys.<BR>\r\nThese are rarely prepared in advance, but are done when needed.<BR>\r\nDifferent substances need different proportions of syrup. Light\r\nvegetable powders usually<BR>\r\nrequire twice their weight, gum resins 2/3 their weight, mineral\r\nsubstances about half their<BR>\r\nweight. If an electuary is made up in advance and it hardens,\r\nadd more syrup. If it swells<BR>\r\nup and emits gas, merely beat it in a mortar.<BR>\r\nExtracts<BR>\r\nExtracts are solid substances resulting from the evaporation of\r\nthe solution of vegetable<BR>\r\nprinciples. The extract is obtained in three ways: by expressing\r\nthe juice of fresh plants, by<BR>\r\nusing a solvent such as alcohol, or simmering a plant tea and\r\nreducing it to a thickened state.<BR>\r\nThe last is done by simmering a plant and by repeating the process\r\nuntil most of the water<BR>\r\nused has evaporated, making a decoction. This gives a distillation\r\nof the most active<BR>\r\nprinciples in the plant. Add 1/4 teaspoon of alcohol (brandy,\r\ngin or vodka will do),<BR>\r\nglycerin, or tincture of benzoine to preserve the extract.<BR>\r\nFomentations<BR>\r\nA fomentation is a strong herbal tea in which a clean cloth is\r\ndipped.<BR>\r\nThe cloth can be filled with herbs. The cloth is then applied\r\nto the affected part.<BR>\r\nInfusions:<BR>\r\nThis is the origin of the idea of witches potion. It is a process\r\nof soaking herbs in water.<BR>\r\nHot Infusion : To make an infusion boil water. Add the boiled\r\nwater to 1 teaspoon dried herb.<BR>\r\nCover and let steep for 9-13 minutes. Strain, cool. Infusions\r\nare drunk as teas, added to bath,<BR>\r\nrubbed into furniture and floors, and to anoint body. Powdered\r\nBark, root, seeds, resin and<BR>\r\nbruised nuts, seeds, bark and buds may be used in hot infusions.<BR>\r\nCold infusion : Steep in cold water or cold milk for several hours.<BR>\r\nWet, mashed herbs can be used internally as a tea or ad poultices\r\non body.<BR>\r\nOils:<BR>\r\nAromatic oils and rectified alcohol can be combined. The oils\r\nseep into the alcohol to produce<BR>\r\nan essence. Oils may be captured by evaporation from flower petals.\r\nVegetable, nut, or fruit<BR>\r\noils can be used as a medium for steeping aromatic plants to extract\r\nvolatile oils. Aromatic oils<BR>\r\ncan also be steeped in alcohol to extract essence.<BR>\r\nTo make an oil, pick your own fresh herbs or purchase dried herbs\r\nform a reputable source.<BR>\r\nPack a large jar with the chosen herb and pour in any favorite\r\nmono unsaturated or<BR>\r\npolyunsaturated oil. Use enough to cover the herb. Close tightly.\r\nLabel the jar and place in<BR>\r\na sunny place for several weeks. Strain out the herb by pouring\r\nthrough cheesecloth into a fresh jar.<BR>\r\nHold the cheesecloth over the opening of the jar containing the\r\nherbs and secure with a rubber band.<BR>\r\nInvert the jar and pour the infused oil through the cheesecloth.<BR>\r\nBefore discarding the herbs, squeeze all the oil out of them.\r\nRepeat the entire procedure.<BR>\r\nRepack a clean jar with more of the same herb. Add the infused\r\noil, plus enough additional<BR>\r\noil to cover the herbs. Store again in sunlight. Strain again\r\nthrough cheesecloth. Pour the oil<BR>\r\ninto a labeled jar and store until needed.<BR>\r\nSyrups:<BR>\r\nMedicinal syrups are formed when sugar is incorporated with vegetable\r\ninfusions, decoctions,<BR>\r\nexpressed juices, fermented liquors, or simple water solutions.\r\nSometimes tinctures are added<BR>\r\nto a simple syrup, and the alcohol is evaporated. The tincture\r\nis sometimes combined with sugar<BR>\r\nand gently heated, or exposed to the sun until the alcohol is\r\nevaporated. The syrup is then<BR>\r\nprepared with the impregnated sugar and water. Refined sugar makes\r\na clearer and better<BR>\r\nflavored syrup. Any simple syrup can be preserved by substituting\r\nglycerin for a certain<BR>\r\nportion of the syrup. Always make syrups in small quantities.<BR>\r\nTo make an herbal syrup, add 2 ounces of dried herb with 1 quart\r\nwater in a large pot.<BR>\r\nBoil down and reduce to 1 pint, then add 1-2 tablespoons of honey.\r\nIf you want to use fresh<BR>\r\nfruit, leaves, or roots in syrups, you should double the amount\r\nof herbs. Store in refrigerator<BR>\r\nfor up to a month. Honey-based syrups are simple and effective\r\nway to preserve healing<BR>\r\nqualities of herbs. Syrups can soothe sore throats and provide\r\nsome relief from coughs.<BR>\r\nTeas:<BR>\r\nHome-made herbal teas are much more potent than the store bought\r\nteas.<BR>\r\nTheir flavor can be quite strong and sometimes unpleasant. To\r\nmake a tea, boil 1 pint of water.<BR>\r\nAdd 1 ounce of dried herb tops ( leaves flowers, stems) steep\r\n3 -5 minutes.<BR>\r\nTinctures<BR>\r\nTinctures are solutions of medicinal substances in alcohol or\r\ndiluted alcohol.<BR>\r\nTo make a tincture, grind plant parts with mortar and pestle (or\r\na blender).<BR>\r\nAdd just enough high-quality vodka, whiskey or grain alcohol to\r\ncover herbs.<BR>\r\nLet sit for 21 days then add a small quantity of glycerin (about\r\n2 tbs per pint) and about<BR>\r\n10 % volume of spring water.<BR>\r\nStrain and store in airtight amber colored glass. If kept cool\r\nand dry it will last for up to 5 years.<BR>\r\nDose is usually 20 drops in a cup of tea or warm water, 4 times\r\na day.<BR>\r\nFor a stronger tincture place herbs in a cone-shaped piece of\r\nparchment paper.<BR>\r\nPass alcohol repeatedly through the powdered or cut herb. Catch\r\nthe slow drippings in a jar.<BR>\r\nWhen it has passed once, you may use it, but the more you repeat\r\nthe process, the stronger<BR>\r\nthe tincture will be. It is acceptable to dilute any alcohol tincture\r\nwith water.<BR>\r\nAdd 4 ounces of water and 1 teaspoon of glycerin for every pint\r\nof alcohol.<BR>\r\nThe glycerin is optional, it is an additional preservative.<BR>\r\nNon Alcoholic Tincture<BR>\r\nAlcohol is a near perfect preservative of plant attributes.<BR>\r\nIf for some reason you wish to evaporate the alcohol, add the\r\ntincture dose to a<BR>\r\ncup of water then add 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon of boiling water. Some\r\nherbs can be<BR>\r\nsteeped in milk to make a milk tincture.<BR>\r\nStrain out the herbs, and store in a labeled jar in the refrigerator.<BR>\r\nOintments<BR>\r\nAn ointment is a soothing, healing, slightly oily or fatty substance\r\ninto which the essence of<BR>\r\na healing plant has been dissolved. This is done by heating the\r\nfat or oil with the plant until<BR>\r\nit loses its normal color and the oil or fat has absorbed the\r\nhealing chemical principles. the<BR>\r\nplant is then strained out, and beeswax is added to harden the\r\nointment. Preservatives such<BR>\r\nas drops of tincture of benzoin, poplar bud tincture, or glycerin\r\nare optional additions. If you<BR>\r\nmake ointments in small batches and keep them tightly closed with\r\nparaffin wax, they don\'t decompose.<BR>\r\nThe traditional folk, herbal, and pharmaceutical base for ointments\r\nis pork lard. Purify it by<BR>\r\nsimmering and straining. It has healing abilities even without\r\nthe addition of herbs, but so do<BR>\r\na lot of fats and oils. It is said to have great drawing power.<BR>\r\nPurified, liquefied anhydrous lanolin is also used as a base for\r\nointments.<BR>\r\nLanolin is the substance washed from the wool of sheep.<BR>\r\nIt comes in many levels of purity, so the results vary depending\r\non the product.<BR>\r\nThis oil is the closest to skin oil.<BR>\r\nAlmond oil, cocoa butter, wheat germ, and vitamin E are neutral\r\nbases for ointments.<BR>\r\nIf no other product is available, Vaseline may be used, but is\r\nlisted here in case nothing else is available.<BR>\r\nAll ointments must contain one substance that will thicken the\r\nfinal product.<BR>\r\nLanolin is a thickener, as is cocoa butter. Both are non sticky\r\nand mix well with most other oils.<BR>\r\nOther useful but sticky thickeners are glycerin, honey, or liquid\r\nlecithin.<BR>\r\nAlso, various powdered resins and gum swell up and thicken when\r\nfirst soaked in cold water,<BR>\r\nthen simmered in gently boiling water, and added to preparations.<BR>\r\nAgar-agar and Irish moss are seaweed thickeners.<BR>\r\nGreen apples provide and excellent acid fruit pectin that is a\r\ngood addition to creams and ointments.<BR>\r\nWhile any of the above sticky and non sticky thickeners will help\r\nswell a product and keep it<BR>\r\nemulsified, you will still need some wax to harden a cold cream\r\nor ointment.<BR>\r\nBeeswax is perfect, although expensive. It may be combined with\r\nparaffin wax.<BR>\r\nPoultices<BR>\r\nA poultice is a raw or mashed herb applied directly to the body,\r\nor applied wet directly to the<BR>\r\nbody, or encased in a clean cloth and then applied. Poultices\r\nare used to heal bruises, putrid<BR>\r\nsores, soothe abrasions, or withdraw toxins from an area. They\r\nmay be applied hot or cold,<BR>\r\ndepending on the health need. Cold poultices(and compresses) are\r\nused to withdraw the heat<BR>\r\nfrom an inflamed or congested area. Use a hot poultice or compress\r\nto relax spasms and for some pains.<BR>\r\nTo make a poultice, use fresh or dried herbs that have been soaked\r\nin boiling water until soft.<BR>\r\nMix with enough slippery elm powder to make poultice stick together.\r\nPlace on affected part<BR>\r\nthen wrap body part and poultice with clean cloth.<BR>\r\nVinegars<BR>\r\nHerbs that are soluble in alcohol are usually soluble in vinegar,\r\nand are useful for salad vinegars,<BR>\r\ncosmetic vinegars, some liniments and preventive sickroom &quot;washes&quot;.<BR>\r\nWaters<BR>\r\nSteeped herbs, water, and alcohol and steeped herbs plus honey\r\nand other fruits are often called waters.<BR>\r\nSometimes extracts or spirits of various herbs, such as lavender,\r\nare also called waters.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1">HERBAL REMEDIES<BR>\r\nGOLDENSEAL<BR>\r\nStudies show that this herb has antibiotic action.<BR>\r\nhow to: For tea, 1/2 to 1 teaspoon powdered root per cup, steeped\r\n10 minutes.

If you are a smoker, and you are sick\r\nand can\'t stop coughing from a cold,<BR>\r\nyou can smoke some Mullein instead of Tobacco. It may help you\r\nto stop coughing, and you will<BR>\r\nhave smoked one less cigarette. If you are not a smoker, stick\r\nwith tincture (extract) or Mullein tea.<BR>\r\nAfter all, there\'s no need to smoke when you\'re sick in your lungs.<BR>\r\nIt also has almost no flavor and is a very light smoke.<BR>\r\nCrispy dried crushed Mullein is a lousy smoke. Be sure to keep\r\nit ever so slightly moist.<BR>\r\nDried Mullein should be rubbed for the best results. It will become\r\nvery fluffy and puffy.<BR>\r\nThis fuzzy rubbed Mullein will burn evenly when smoked in a paper\r\nor pipe.<BR>\r\nIt will hold other herbs that are in the form of small pieces\r\nand powder, and keep them evenly distributed.<BR>\r\nAnd it has no flavor! Ideal for a smoking base; I use it in almost\r\nevery smoking mixture.<BR>\r\nI like the light green baby leaves found in the center of the\r\nfirst year basal rosette, but it\'s a<BR>\r\nmatter of personal choice. Any leaf will work.<BR>\r\nHorehound, Marrubium vulgare, and Coltsfoot, Tussilago farfara<BR>\r\nThese commonly used smoking ingredients are expectorants.<BR>\r\nThey promote coughing and aid in the upward flow of mucus.<BR>\r\nLet me relate to you a story I have heard more times than I can\r\ncount on my hands and my feet.<BR>\r\nThe person hears that Coltsfoot was smoked by the Native Americans.<BR>\r\nThey run to the health food store, roll up a cigarette of dried\r\nraspy Coltsfoot, and proceed to<BR>\r\nsmoke it as if it was marijuana. After they cough a piece of their\r\nbrains out, they decide that<BR>\r\nperhaps this wasn\'t such a good idea. However, the difference\r\nbetween poison and medicine is dosage.<BR>\r\nIf used properly, these herbs are very effective healthful herbs.<BR>\r\nMix these herbs in medium amounts with other herbs.<BR>\r\nIf the mixture makes you cough too much, use less of the expectorant.<BR>\r\nThey are ideal for a general lung cleanse, for the ending of respiratory\r\nflus and colds,<BR>\r\nwhen you\'re quitting Tobacco, and to get the crud out of you lungs\r\nin general.<BR>\r\nDo not use them when you are coughing up blood or if it hurts\r\nwhen you breathe.<BR>\r\nSee a qualified health professional if this is the case. Also,\r\ndo not use them when you can not stop<BR>\r\ncoughing. If this is the case, stick with Mullein. Ideally theses\r\nmixtures should not make you<BR>\r\ncough incessantly, but just cough effectively once in a while,\r\nbringing up some of that excess phlegm.<BR>\r\nJimson Weed Seeds, Datura<BR>\r\nOne good reason to smoke an herb as a preferred method of ingestion\r\nis regulation of dosage.<BR>\r\nYou can smoke an herb that is very strong and regulate the dosage\r\nsafety.<BR>\r\nThe difference between medicine and poison is dosage.<BR>\r\nMany plants are too strong to take internally safely. If you take\r\na tea, it may take half an hour or<BR>\r\nmore before you can tell how strong of a dosage you took. At that\r\npoint it is too late to take less.<BR>\r\nWhen you smoke an herb the effects or side effects become<BR>\r\napparent quickly. If the herb doesn\'t agree with you, you can\r\nstop before overdosing.<BR>\r\nJimson weed is definitely a strong hallucinogen, poison, medicine\r\nany way you look at it.<BR>\r\nThe dosage is all important. I do not recommend internal use of\r\nDatura without guidance.<BR>\r\nThe use of Datura for a high by pimply adolescents looking for\r\nsome fireworks is deplorable.<BR>\r\nToo many of them end up as newspaper reports. People have landed\r\nin the<BR>\r\nhospital for extended stays because of this plant.<BR>\r\nUsed in the proper dosages, Datura can be a very effective treatment\r\nfor a variety of problems.<BR>\r\nSmoke the crushed seeds only. The seeds are the mildest part of\r\nthe plant. Just a few puffs will<BR>\r\nanesthetize your throat and lungs. This could be very helpful\r\nwith some lung problems.<BR>\r\nYou will not feel psychological effects from this small a dosage.\r\nI have used this method of<BR>\r\ntaking this herb and will guarantee that you will not get high\r\nfrom two puffs. This plant does<BR>\r\nnot agree with some people. If you feel light headed or nauseous,\r\nthen stop smoking it.<BR>\r\nIn some oversea countries, you may find that the cigarettes still\r\ncontain Datura leaf.<BR>\r\nDatura has been used as smoking mixtures in a variety of cultures.<BR>\r\nGenerally this is for their hallucinogenic effect and doesn\'t\r\nconcern us in this book.<BR>\r\nHerbs to Quit Smoking Tobacco<BR>\r\nLet\'s face it, herbal smoking mixtures will not cause you to quit\r\nTobacco.<BR>\r\nOnly you can cause you to stop. Smoking mixtures can aid in the\r\nprocess if you are ready.<BR>\r\nA variety of mixtures can be helpful.<BR>\r\nAt first, a thick bodied flavorful smoke with Lobelia and calming\r\nherbs is indicated.<BR>\r\nAfter the physical withdrawal is finished with, drop the Lobelia\r\nsmoke and use a calming smoke<BR>\r\nwith lots of astringent herbs for a heavy &quot;Tobacco&quot;\r\nsmoke. In reality, no herbal smoking mixture<BR>\r\ntastes as &quot;thick&quot; as Tobacco. Be sure to add some Mullein\r\nand possibly some expectorants to<BR>\r\naid in the cleansing process. Finally, you may wish to cut the\r\nastringents and just go with the very<BR>\r\nlight Mullein alone. Mullein is so light it will feel as you aren\'t\r\nreally smoking anything, and you will<BR>\r\neventually lose interest in it. This regimen is an example, and\r\ncan be modified to your own personal<BR>\r\nneeds. Other herbs, taken as tea or tincture, may be helpful during\r\nthe withdrawal process.<BR>\r\nA liver stimulant like Oregon Grape Root or Goldenseal may help\r\nyour body remove the nicotine quicker.<BR>\r\nThis won\'t make the withdrawal symptoms easier, but it will just\r\nspeed it up.<BR>\r\nSalicylate herbs, like Willow and Oak, can help with headaches.\r\nCalming herbs like Skullcap,<BR>\r\nValerian, and Parrot\'s Beak, are definitely indicated. After the\r\nphysical addiction is broken, it\'s<BR>\r\nup to you to break the psychological addiction.<BR>\r\nLobelia, Lobelia inflata<BR>\r\nLobelia is another example of a strong herb whose dosage can be\r\nregulated by smoking.<BR>\r\nIt is a very strong muscle relaxant and tranquilizer that should\r\nnot be mixed with any other<BR>\r\npharmaceutical tranquilizers or alcohol. It also is an expectorant.\r\nAs an added bonus it is<BR>\r\nan alterative that increases your body\'s own natural defense mechanisms.\r\nAll this makes it ideal as<BR>\r\nan herb to stop smoking with.<BR>\r\nYour body sees Lobelia\'s main ingredient, lobeline, as nicotine.<BR>\r\nCertain receptors in your body are waiting to be filled with nicotine\r\nand so you feel nicotine fits.<BR>\r\nLobeline is the same shape as nicotine and fits into these receptor\r\nsites, fooling your body into<BR>\r\nthinking you\'ve been smoking Tobacco. Lobeline, however, is not\r\naddictive when used properly<BR>\r\nfor the short term.<BR>\r\nThe prescription chewing gums that doctors prescribe to quit smoking\r\nhave lobeline as the main ingredient.<BR>\r\nOne day I had a wicked headache and took some Lobelia. It was\r\na good solid dose;<BR>\r\nI had to sit down but my headache was gone. I went to light a\r\ncigarette, but after one<BR>\r\npuff I could not smoke any more. My body felt as if I had smoked\r\ntoo many cigarettes already.<BR>\r\nIt was just the Lobelia.<BR>\r\nThe important thing to remember about Lobelia is that it is so\r\nstrong.<BR>\r\nWhen making tea, use a teaspoon per 1/2 gallon of water mixed\r\nwith other herbs.<BR>\r\nFor a smoking mixture add a pinch to a bag of other herbs. If\r\nyou do take too much<BR>\r\nLobelia will make you throw up over 90% of the time. Unfortunately,\r\nif you do not throw up,<BR>\r\nyou can have respiratory failure from the sedative effects. This\r\nis a very difficult thing to do<BR>\r\nbecause you\'ll feel so wretched long before it\'s dangerous.<BR>\r\nIn the United States Lobelia is illegal to sell for internal consumption.\r\nCertainly official reasons<BR>\r\ninclude the possibility of poisoning. Strangely enough Lobelia\r\nis extremely effective for a significant<BR>\r\namount of asthmatics. For some people the tincture is useful in\r\nplace of inhalers. I am sure that<BR>\r\nthe powerful pharmaceutical companies losing a significant percentage\r\nof inhaler business has<BR>\r\nnothing to do with this law. When I was a pimply adolescent looking\r\nfor psychic pyrotechnics,<BR>\r\nI found this ad in the back of High Times for legal highs. My\r\nfriends and I purchased some<BR>\r\nLobelia touted as a mild LSD type feeling.<BR>\r\nLeaving our parents and going on a camping trip, we promptly rolled\r\nthick joints of Lobelia<BR>\r\nwhich we smoked endlessly. After puking our guts out, we were\r\nleft with headaches and not<BR>\r\nso vague feelings of depression. We were so bummed out we canceled\r\nthe camping trip.<BR>\r\nThe difference between poison and medicine is dosage. Personal\r\nnote: almost all of the 15 or<BR>\r\nso herbs we tried during that time period had similar results.<BR>\r\nLobelia is the herb for stopping smoking with its calming, expectorant,\r\nalterative, and nicotine<BR>\r\nmimicking effects. When making your mixture, add a pinch of Lobelia.\r\nIf it\'s not satisfying, add more.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1">HERBAL SMOKING MIXTURES<BR>\r\nFlavorings<BR>\r\nSometimes an herbal smoking mixture can be quite bland, or the\r\nsmoker may like<BR>\r\nmenthol cigarettes. The herbs in this section are good for flavoring.\r\nMost are aromatic<BR>\r\nor good smelling herbs with no system wide effect when smoked.<BR>\r\nIf you were to smoke these herbs alone full strength, they wouldn\'t\r\ntaste good.<BR>\r\nThey may even be irritating this way. Only add a little to the\r\nmixture and taste it.<BR>\r\nExperiment to find your own special flavor and strength. Go light\r\nhanded at first.<BR>\r\nFeel free to go further in experimenting with flavors. Any smelly\r\nedible plant might<BR>\r\nbe useful as a flavoring. Look in your spice and tea rack for\r\npossibilities like lemon grass, etc.<BR>\r\nMints, Mentha sp.<BR>\r\nMints are probably the most accessible and used flavoring agents\r\nfor smoking mixtures.<BR>\r\nThey impart a menthol flavor. This includes Spearmint, Peppermint,\r\nand all the numerous<BR>\r\nornamental varieties such as Apple Mint, etc.<BR>\r\nRemember to go light so as not to irritate your lungs and throat.<BR>\r\nMugwort Herbaceous Artemisia sp. (not shrubs)<BR>\r\nMug means glass; Wort means plant. It\'s the mug plant used for\r\nbeer in medieval times.<BR>\r\nIt is also used today at country fairs and gatherings by the more\r\nesoteric beer makers.<BR>\r\nIt replaces hops in the beer formulas.<BR>\r\nMugwort is a very interesting plant deep in historical references.\r\nIt is often said to promote<BR>\r\nprophetic dreams. It seems to me that Mugwort intensifies the\r\ndreaming process.<BR>\r\nIt all depends on where you are in this process.<BR>\r\nIf you don\'t dream, Mugwort will help you to dream, but you may\r\nnot remember them.<BR>\r\nIf you don\'t remember your dreams Mugwort will help you to remember\r\nthem. If you remember<BR>\r\nyour dreams, Mugwort will help you to have conscious dreams. Conscious\r\ndreams are dreams<BR>\r\nwhere you are aware that you are dreaming and in full control\r\nof the situation. If you are<BR>\r\nconsciously dreaming already, the plant will increase the frequency\r\nand control.<BR>\r\nNone of this implies that the dreams will be pleasant. Some people\r\ndon\'t remember their<BR>\r\ndreams for a reason. Mugwort can cause nightmares and restless\r\ndreams leading to lack<BR>\r\nof sleep or poor quality of sleep.<BR>\r\nCertainly, Mugwort can lead to prophetic dreams if that is what\r\nyou are into. I do not prefer that<BR>\r\ncourse of dream work. It is all up to you. One of my long term\r\nstudents feels that Mugwort is the<BR>\r\nmost reality altering of all the psychotropics he\'s tried. Maybe\r\nyou will too.<BR>\r\nThese effects are most pronounced with long term exposure to the\r\nherb. Dream pillows, fresh<BR>\r\nbundles allowed to dry by your bed, and smoking over a period\r\nof weeks. You may not always<BR>\r\nexperience the subtle effects with one joint.<BR>\r\nYou can smoke Mugwort alone, but it\'s best to use as a flavoring\r\nagent because it is strongly<BR>\r\naromatic. Mugwort can also be rubbed into a very good consistency\r\nas a carrier for the smoking<BR>\r\nmixture like Mullein but the flavor can overwhelm the mixture.<BR>\r\nInternal use of Mugwort has physiological effects on your stomach\r\nand female reproductive<BR>\r\nsystem but this will not transfer through smoking.<BR>\r\nTarragon is a herbaceous Artemisia called Artemisia dranunculus\r\nor Dragon Sagewort.<BR>\r\nSagebrush, shrubby Artemisia sp.<BR>\r\nSagebrush is a shrub found growing throughout the desert western\r\nUnited States.<BR>\r\nIt is in the Sunflower family and is not related in any way to\r\nthe Salvia Sage used in cooking.<BR>\r\nIt has been traditionally used to purify the environment. It is\r\nindeed an anti- bacterial for airborne bacteria.<BR>\r\nOften found in Sage sticks, and in stores labeled as Sage, it\r\ncan be used as a flavoring for smoking mixtures.<BR>\r\nNative people used this plant like Salvia if they lived in an\r\narea where there was no Salvia.<BR>\r\nSage including White, Black, and Hummingbird, Salvia sp.<BR>\r\nThere are many kinds of Salvia Sages. Some are good to smoke as\r\nflavors including the white, black,<BR>\r\npurple and garden Sages. Some are not so pleasant but worth a\r\ntry. Some of these Sages were used<BR>\r\nby Native Americans for purification rituals. They are in the\r\nmint family and are not related to Artemisia<BR>\r\nSagebrush or Mugwort. These are also found in sage sticks.<BR>\r\nLemon Balm, Melissa officinalis<BR>\r\nMelissa is an herb often escaped from gardens and easy to find\r\nin the Pacific Northwest growing<BR>\r\nwild in cities. It is a very mild and friendly calming herb that\r\nwill add a peaceful lemony flavor to<BR>\r\nany blend.<BR>\r\nYerba Buena , Satureja douglasii<BR>\r\nYerba Buena is a good herb for flavoring that grows in the coastal\r\nwest. It should not be confused<BR>\r\nwith peppermint, which is also sometimes called Yerba Buena. It\r\nhas a menthol flavor that should<BR>\r\nsatisfy those people who like &quot;Kools.&quot;<BR>\r\nAngelica, Angelica sp.<BR>\r\nAngelica has many physiological effects when taken internally.<BR>\r\nWhen smoked as a flavoring in small amounts, it should have no\r\nsystem wide effects.<BR>\r\nYou can use the root, dried and powdered and thoroughly mixed\r\nwith the rest of the blend.<BR>\r\nFeel free to experiment with the leaves and green seeds for different\r\nflavor and strengths.<BR>\r\nOsha, Oshala, Lovage , Ligusticum sp.<BR>\r\nLigusticums are yet another very special herb that the Native\r\nAmericans deemed powerful<BR>\r\nand sacred. Ligusticum porteri, Osha, is called Peyote\'s little\r\nsister. All native Ligusticums<BR>\r\nwere held in high regard by the local Natives. As a smoke it is\r\nonly a flavor. You can use the root,<BR>\r\ndried and powered, but I find that the root hairs, not usually\r\nused for their medicinal<BR>\r\neffects, to be the best for flavor.<BR>\r\nClove<BR>\r\nA common kitchen spice used with a light hand. Use the powder.\r\nClove cigarettes with Tobacco<BR>\r\nwere very popular for a while. Clove can be very irritating to\r\nthe esophagus and lungs. This, together<BR>\r\nwith the exceptionally strong Tobacco found in these imported\r\ncigarettes, quickly caused lung and<BR>\r\nesophageal problems. I have known many singers who have lost their\r\nvoices in a few weeks of clove<BR>\r\ncigarette smoking. So feel free to use it, but respect it.<BR>\r\nLavender<BR>\r\nUse the flowers and rub them if you wish. I love the smell of\r\nlavender but I hate the taste of smoked<BR>\r\ndried lavender. Perhaps you will love it, feel free to check it\r\nout.<BR>\r\nSweet Cicely, Osmorhiza sp.<BR>\r\nThis is another local Pacific Northwest plant with a pleasant\r\naromatic anise flavor. You can use the<BR>\r\nroot dried, powdered if it smells good. Seeds are also useful.<BR>\r\nGinger<BR>\r\nUse dried powder, thoroughly mixed with a light hand.<BR>\r\nLicorice<BR>\r\nUse dried powder, thoroughly mixed with a light hand.<BR>\r\nAnise<BR>\r\nFor those who like the licorice flavor, try these seeds.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1">HERBAL SMOKING MIXTURES<BR>\r\nThis file may be reprinted and distributed freely as long as it\r\nremains unchanged.<BR>\r\nSTANDARD SMOKING MIX<BR>\r\nRubbed Mullein leaf as a base Kinnikinnik leaf, for body, finely\r\nbroken<BR>\r\nOptionally Manzanita leaf and Pipsissewa for added body Optional\r\nflavoring herbs to taste<BR>\r\nANOTHER FAVORITE MIX<BR>\r\nRubbed Mullein leaf as a base Willow Bark, finely cut for body<BR>\r\nSkullcap Leaf, for calming effects Osha Root, finely ground for\r\nflavor<BR>\r\nMix thoroughly.

Not so. Herbalists kick around a lot of terms,\r\nso let\'s define a few of them:<BR>\r\nPotion -- It\'s an herbal tea prepared during the appropriate lunar\r\nphase and made<BR>\r\nwith herbal ingredients possessing the correct magickal properties.<BR>\r\nPotions concocted for love Magick are called philters.<BR>\r\nInfusion -- a strong tea. Many recipes will call for a full oz.\r\nof herb to one pint of water.<BR>\r\nSome think that\'s too much. Just throw in the amount that feels\r\nright. This is simply the<BR>\r\nprocess of soaking the herb in water. Heat water until just boiling,\r\npour it over the herb,<BR>\r\ncover the cup, let sit undisturbed for 15-30 minutes. Drink it.\r\nWash with it.<BR>\r\nPour it in your bath or anoint yourself with it.<BR>\r\nSolar infusions -- put fresh or dried herbs in a jar with cool\r\nwater. Place in the sun for 1-2 days.<BR>\r\nSolar infusions seem to have more plant spirit. It\'s good to work\r\nwith the astrological<BR>\r\nsigns here if possible -- an appropriate sun sign or other aspect.<BR>\r\nLunar infusions -- same as solar infusions, but placed under the\r\nmoonlight.<BR>\r\nChoose the best moon signs and phases here.<BR>\r\nDecoction -- a decoction is made like an infusion, but here it\r\nis OK to boil the herb.<BR>\r\nUsually decoctions are made from roots or other herbs with constituents\r\nthat are not<BR>\r\neasily extracted. Roots, seeds, and stems make good decoctions.\r\nBegin with cold water,<BR>\r\nand add the toughest roots, etc., first. Bring to a boil and simmer\r\nfor about 30 minutes covered.<BR>\r\nThen let cool completely. If adding leaves or dried herbs to a\r\ndecoction, you can take<BR>\r\nthe decoction off the stove and steep your less hardy herbs as\r\nyou would an infusion.<BR>\r\nBe sure to cover throughout the process so your volatile oils\r\ndon\'t boil away.<BR>\r\nStrain. Some recommend one oz. of herb to one pint water. Others\r\nuse one part herb to 20 parts water.<BR>\r\nTincture -- if long term storage is required, you will probably\r\nwant to make a tincture.<BR>\r\nA tincture contains alcohol. Into a mason jar with lid, place\r\n4 oz. of herb and 8 oz. of alcohol.<BR>\r\nSeal the jar and keep it out of sunlight for two weeks.<BR>\r\nBegin this process on the new moon and finish on the full moon.<BR>\r\nBe sure to swish the herbs around in the jar daily. Strain and\r\nstore in dark bottles.<BR>\r\nWash -- a weak tea or infusion that is used externally.<BR>\r\nA mild wash -- 1/4 oz. herb to one pint boiling water -- can be\r\nused to cleanse<BR>\r\nmagickal tools, crystals, or other magickal uses.<BR>\r\nAspurger -- a weak tea (wash) put in a watering can or spray bottle\r\nused for spraying<BR>\r\nan area or thing. Many witches like to use the more natural tree\r\nlimb with leaves still attached.<BR>\r\nDip it in the wash and shake it through the area. Especially good\r\nfor cleansing spells or<BR>\r\nexorcism when working with rooms, houses, or large areas.<BR>\r\nOintments/Balms -- I include balms in these definitions because\r\nthe oils used in balms are<BR>\r\nheated to a liquid state during preparation. Simply melt lard/vegetable\r\nshortening/or any<BR>\r\nfatty substance to a liquid form over low heat. Pour in herbs\r\nand let them simmer for about<BR>\r\nnine minutes. Strain out the herbs and store in an airtight jar.\r\nOne cup fatty substance to three<BR>\r\ntablespoons powdered herb. For external use.<BR>\r\nPerfumes -- are made by blending essential oils together to create\r\na fragrance. Choose oils to<BR>\r\nmatch your magickal intention, then add them to 1/4 cup rubbing\r\nalcohol, 1/4 cup witch hazel<BR>\r\ntincture, and 1/2 cup water. Shake well, then dab on pulse points.\r\nAromatic herbs work best here.<BR>\r\nOils --many of the essential oils you find in herbal shops have\r\nbeen distilled with steam.<BR>\r\nYou can make oils at home by crushing herbs and placing them in\r\na jar.<BR>\r\nCover them with warmed oil (virgin olive, safflower, and almond\r\nare all good).<BR>\r\nSteep for 48 hours in sunlight. Strain and repeat, adding fresh\r\nherbs.<BR>\r\nYou might do this several times until the oil smells good and\r\nstrong like the herb. Store in dark bottles.<BR>\r\nFlower essences -- these work on energetic and psychic levels.<BR>\r\nPick the flower and place them in fresh spring water -- just let\r\nthem float on the top of the water.<BR>\r\nPlace flowers and/or gems in your crystal bowl full of water in\r\nfull sunlight for several hours.<BR>\r\nThis process will extract the life essence and energy matrix from\r\nthe materials.<BR>\r\nThis is known as your Mother Essence. Add brandy as a preservative.<BR>\r\nFrom this essence will come your stock bottles.<BR>\r\nThe recipe:<BR>\r\nTwo drops of the Mother Essence in one ounce pure water with a\r\nteaspoon of brandy.<BR>\r\nThis is your stock bottle. From these stock bottles will come\r\nyour dosage bottles.<BR>\r\nSimply combine 2 drops from your stock bottles into one ounce\r\npure water and a teaspoon<BR>\r\nbrandy in a dropper bottle. You can take your dose directly from\r\nthe dosage bottle or drop<BR>\r\nthe elixir into a glass of water. Works like homeopathic medicines.<BR>\r\nGem elixirs -- made like flower essences, but using crystals and\r\ngems instead of flowers.<BR>\r\nFluid Condensers -- you need two handfuls of herb, cold water\r\nto cover them, a cauldron or<BR>\r\ncooking pot, and gin or vodka. Place herbs and water in a pot\r\nwith a tight fitting lid.<BR>\r\nBoil for 20 minutes. Cool for 13 minutes, then strain out herbs.<BR>\r\nBring to a boil again and evaporate one-half of the liquid. Take\r\nfrom the heat and cover.<BR>\r\nWhen cool, add an equal amount of gin or vodka. Three drops of\r\nyour own blood from your<BR>\r\nthumb will personalize the condenser and add energy. To use the\r\ncondenser, put it in a<BR>\r\ncauldron or pot and simmer to release the herbal Magick.<BR>\r\nActually, those aromatherapy candle/ simmering potpourri holders\r\nwork very well here.<BR>\r\nPlace the liquid in the top bowl and light a tea light beneath\r\nit.<BR>\r\nLet it evaporate and release its magickal properties into the\r\nair.<BR>\r\nThis liquid can be used as holy water -- sprinkle on parchment\r\nin petition spells, pour into<BR>\r\nthe earth as a libation, sprinkle tools or working area, etc.\r\nYou can also make one for<BR>\r\neach of the four elements and simmer them on your altar during\r\nworkings.<BR>\r\nThese are a few methods for making magickal potions. The thing\r\nthat lifts these potions<BR>\r\nfrom the mundane, medicinal level to a magickal level is your\r\nenchantment of them and<BR>\r\nmagickal timing. Enchant your herbs at the appropriate moon phases\r\nand signs (or other<BR>\r\nplanetary aspects) before preparation by running your fingers\r\nthrough the herb while<BR>\r\nvisualizing your need. You may want to simply enchant the finished\r\npotion.<BR>\r\nFlower essences (which are easily bought in health food stores)\r\nassist with inner work.<BR>\r\nThe potions that use brandy, gin, or vodka are for long term storage.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1">HEALING HERBAL BALM<BR>\r\nHerbs: Calendula (Calendula officinalis) and Plantain (Plantago\r\nmajor)<BR>\r\nThis sweet-smelling balm soothes and protects cuts and scrapes.<BR>\r\nAnd it\'s so gentle you can even use it on diaper rash.<BR>\r\nCalendula and plantain are known for their ability to speed skin\r\nhealing.<BR>\r\nBoth soften skin, relieve pain, and are antibacterial.<BR>\r\nHow to make it: This is a two-step process.<BR>\r\nFirst, you\'ll make an herb-infused oil: In a large glass jar,\r\ncombine 2 tablespoon each of crushed<BR>\r\nCalendula flowers and dried plantain leaves with 1/3 c of extra-virgin\r\nolive oil.<BR>\r\nLeave uncovered, and place in a pan filled with enough water to\r\ncover the lower half of the jar.<BR>\r\nSet the burner on very low heat and simmer gently for about 4\r\nhours.<BR>\r\nCheck the oil periodically to be sure it\'s not scorching; don\'t\r\nlet it boil.<BR>\r\n(You can also make the infused oil in a Crock-Pot set on very\r\nlow without a lid.)<BR>\r\nAfter the allotted time, remove the oil from the heat and allow\r\nit to cool completely.<BR>\r\nStrain away the herbs through several layers of cheesecloth and\r\ndiscard.<BR>\r\nTo make the balm, combine the infused oil with 1 or 2 tablespoon\r\nof grated beeswax<BR>\r\nand put it into a small stainless steel bowl; set the bowl into\r\na pot of water and heat just<BR>\r\nuntil the beeswax melts, stirring gently to help the melting.<BR>\r\nTo test the consistency, insert a cool metal spoon into the balm\r\nand check the balm that<BR>\r\nsticks to the spoon; it should be spreadable but firm. If it\'s\r\ntoo oily, add another few<BR>\r\nshavings of beeswax. At this point, you can add a natural preservative\r\nto your balm to<BR>\r\nprevent spoilage. Vitamin E, squeezed from capsules, works very\r\nwell.<BR>\r\nRosemary extracts or oil might improve the aroma and antiseptic\r\nproperties as well.<BR>\r\nYou\'ll need about 1/4 tsp. (two capsules) to preserve this much\r\nbalm.<BR>\r\nAfter you\'ve blended in the vitamin E, transfer your final product\r\nto a sterile glass jar.<BR>\r\nUse a clean spoon or small spatula to transfer the balm to avoid\r\nintroducing bacteria to the jar.<BR>\r\nHow to use it: Apply the balm to rashes, scrapes, and other small\r\nor superficial abrasions<BR>\r\n(don\'t use it on deep cuts). You can also apply it regularly to\r\nhelp heal chronically chapped skin.<BR>\r\nStored in a cool, dark place, the balm should keep for up to a\r\nyear. Discard if it smells rancid.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1">HERBAL TEA CORRESPONDENCES<BR>\r\nAnise- Calling Spirits<BR>\r\nBergamont- Success<BR>\r\nBurdock Root- Purity, Protection<BR>\r\nChamomile- Mediation<BR>\r\nElder Flower- Divination<BR>\r\nEyebright- Mental and Psychic Power<BR>\r\nHyssop- Purification<BR>\r\nLemon (Leaves)- Lust<BR>\r\nLemon Balm- Health, Success<BR>\r\nMugwort- Divination<BR>\r\nMullien- Divination<BR>\r\nRose Hips- Psychic Power and Divination</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1">SMUDGING<BR>\r\nSage<BR>\r\nThere are two major genii and several varieties of each genus\r\nof Sage that are used for smudging.<BR>\r\nSalvia, or the herb sage used for cooking, comes in two major\r\nvarieties: S. Officinalis, commonly<BR>\r\nknown as Garden Sage, and S. Apiana, commonly known as White Sage.\r\nSalvia varieties have<BR>\r\nlong been acknowledged as healing herbs, reflected in the fact\r\nthat its genus name comes from<BR>\r\nthe Latin root word *salvare*, which is the verb &quot;to heal&quot;\r\nor &quot;to save.&quot; Artemisia is the genus<BR>\r\ncommonly considered &quot;Sagebrush&quot;, and is more common\r\nin the wilds out here in California.<BR>\r\nThere are two major varieties to the Artemisia genus: A. Californica,\r\nor Common Sagebrush, and<BR>\r\nA. Vulgaris, or Mugwort. There are many other varieties of both\r\nSalvia and Artemisia, and all are<BR>\r\neffective in smudging. Sage is burned in smudging ceremonies to\r\ndrive out evil spirits, negative<BR>\r\nthoughts and feelings, and to keep Gan\'n (negative entities) away\r\nfrom areas where ceremonials<BR>\r\ntake place. In the Plains Sweatlodge, the floor of the structure\r\nis strewn with sage leaves for the<BR>\r\nparticipants to rub on their bodies during the sweat.<BR>\r\nSage is also used in keeping sacred objects like pipes or Peyote\r\nwands safe from negative influence.<BR>\r\nIn the Sioux nation, the Sacred Pipe is kept in a bundle with\r\nsage boughs.<BR>\r\nCedar<BR>\r\nTrue cedar is of the Thuja and Libocedrus genii. Some Junipers\r\n(Juniperus genus) are also<BR>\r\ncalled &quot;cedar&quot;, thus complicating things some. Some\r\nJuniper varieties ARE cleansing herbs,<BR>\r\nespecially J. Monosperma, or Desert White Cedar. But for smudging,\r\nthe best is Western Red<BR>\r\nCedar (Thuja occidentalis) and California Incense Cedar (Libocedrus\r\ndescurrens). Cedar is<BR>\r\nburnt while praying to the Great Spirit in meditation, and also\r\nto bless a house before moving<BR>\r\nin as is the tradition in the Northwest and Western Canada. It\r\nworks both as a purifier and<BR>\r\nas a way to attract good energy in your direction. It is usually\r\navailable in herb stores in chipped<BR>\r\nform, which must be sprinkled over a charcoal in a brazier. A\r\npiece of charcoaled mesquite<BR>\r\nworks well for this purpose, rather than the commercial charcoal\r\ncake.<BR>\r\nSweetgrass<BR>\r\nVery important to the Sioux and Cherokee nations, its botanical\r\nname is Hierochloe Oderata.<BR>\r\nIn these tribes, the sweetgrass is braided like hair braids. It\r\ncould be burnt by lighting the end<BR>\r\nof it, or (more economically) by shaving little bits of it onto\r\ncharcoal in a brazier. Again, use<BR>\r\ncharcoaled Mesquite (I believe it comes packaged for barbecue\r\nuse under the brand name<BR>\r\n&quot;Red Arrow&quot;) to burn it, not pressed charcoal tablets.\r\nSweetgrass is burnt after smudging with<BR>\r\nsage, to welcome in good influences after the bad had been driven\r\nout. Sweetgrass is very<BR>\r\nrare today, and traditional Plains people have been attempting\r\nto protect the last of it.<BR>\r\nCedar, which is not endangered, can safely be used this way. Also\r\nPinon pine<BR>\r\nneedles (used more frequently by the Southwest Teneh, like the\r\nNavajo and Apache as well<BR>\r\nas the Pueblo people and the Zuni) and Copal (used by the Yaqui\r\nand in ancient times by the<BR>\r\nAzteca and the Maya) have similar effect. The three mentioned\r\nhere are readily available either<BR>\r\nthrough gathering yourself or, in the case of copal resin, from\r\nany good herb shop.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1">SCENTED OILS AND THEIR MAGICKAL\r\nPOWERS<BR>\r\nACACIA: Possessing high spiritual vibrations, this oil is worn\r\nto aid meditation and to<BR>\r\ndevelop psychic powers.

Imagine, seeing the salt burning away negativity as you<BR>\r\nsprinkle and toss it. Your purification will be as strong as your\r\nvisualization. <BR>\r\nNext, set the salt down and pick up the censor or incense, carry\r\nit <BR>\r\nfrom room to room (The same route you used with the salt...walking<BR>\r\nclockwise...group following and repeating) Be sure to hold it\r\nbefore <BR>\r\nall windows and doors, and in the corners of each room.

Sit or stand comfortably, holding\r\nthe candle. <BR>\r\nClose your eyes, relax and take a few minutes to begin breathing\r\nregularly <BR>\r\nand establish your concentration. (If you\'ve ever done regular\r\nmeditation or prayer, <BR>\r\nestablish that same frame of mind.) <BR>\r\nNow visualize the house through a stranger\'s eyes. In your mind,\r\nenvision brilliant <BR>\r\nsunlight, whether it\'s there in real life or not. Mentally walk\r\nfrom the driveway to the <BR>\r\nfront door (or whatever entrance is closest), then into the house.<BR>\r\nAs you do this, envision the house as the most beautiful it can\r\nbe. If the paint is <BR>\r\nclean and white, envision it positively gleaming. If there are\r\nplants in the yard, <BR>\r\nenvision them not just thriving, but seeming to beckon the passer-by,\r\nreaching their <BR>\r\nlittle green selves up into that same brilliant light. <BR>\r\nIn your mind\'s eye, walk through the entire house with the eyes\r\nof a stranger, <BR>\r\ndwelling on every good point it has. Do not let thoughts of its\r\nflaws disrupt your c<BR>\r\noncentration (this is the tough part). That same brilliant sunlight\r\npours through every <BR>\r\nwindow and door. See it fill up each room as you enter. <BR>\r\nWhen you have been through the entire house, go back the way you\r\ncame. Envision <BR>\r\nthe light from each room pouring into your mind, through your\r\nbody, and out through <BR>\r\nyour hands into the candle. Like a battery, the candle will absorb\r\nthis light energy. <BR>\r\nTake a few moments in each room to let this happen. (There\'s a\r\nlot of light; it won\'t <BR>\r\ndiminish in the room when it pours into you.) <BR>\r\nNow mentally go out through the same door and stand in the driveway,\r\nseeing the house <BR>\r\ncovered with brilliant light. Again, feel the light that surrounds\r\nthe house pour into you, <BR>\r\nand from you into the candle. <BR>\r\nWhen you\'re done, continue to sit or stand for a few moments with\r\nyour eyes shut, <BR>\r\nand let any excess energy that remains in your body flow naturally\r\ninto the ground. <BR>\r\nThen open your eyes. <BR>\r\nLight the candle at an appropriate time - the night before a showing\r\nmight be good. <BR>\r\nA Witch would probably wait for the full moon (a time of bounty)\r\nor the first quarter moon <BR>\r\n(a time for new beginnings). An astrological magician might do\r\nso on a Monday <BR>\r\n(the day of the moon) or a Thursday (the day of Jupiter, the Bestower).<BR>\r\nAs you light the candle, intone the words of the spell: <BR>\r\n&quot;Fill my home with energy, that it may bring me prosperity.<BR>\r\nLight and beauty fill my home, That its new owners soon may come.&quot;<BR>\r\nLet the candle burn all the way down. (I hope you didn\'t get one\r\nof those 15-hour ones!) <BR>\r\nWhat this visualization does is to fill the house with positive\r\nenergy. <BR>\r\nBuyers respond to this energy whether they\'re aware of it or not.<BR>\r\nBy dwelling on all your home\'s good points, you\'ve filled those\r\nplaces <BR>\r\nin the house with special energy so they won\'t be overlooked.<BR>\r\nAlso: Before each showing, subtly scent the house with cinnamon\r\n- incense, potpourri, <BR>\r\nmaybe one of those lamp rings. Besides being a prosperity herb,\r\ncinnamon\'s aroma makes <BR>\r\npeople think of home cooking, which will make them want to settle\r\ndown there.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">HOUSE CLEANSING<BR>\r\nIf you can identify the actual spirit, locate the center point\r\nof the house, and standing there <BR>\r\ntake a cup of red wine. After each of the following statements\r\ntake a sip of wine, <BR>\r\nand drain the cup after the last direction.<BR>\r\nFacing east:<BR>\r\nLady of love and power and all blessings, breathe love into this\r\nhouse, fill air with good. <BR>\r\nThrough you, in you, I bless this house.<BR>\r\nFacing south: <BR>\r\nLady of love and living and all blessings, warm this house with\r\ncomfort, make whole its hearth. <BR>\r\nThrough you, in you, I bless this house.<BR>\r\nFacing west: <BR>\r\nLady of tide and time and every blessing, let every hour flow\r\nsweetly in this house.<BR>\r\nThrough you, in you, I bless this house.<BR>\r\nFacing north: <BR>\r\nLady of strength and riches and all blessings, make this house\r\nstrong and filled with earthly good. <BR>\r\nThrough you, in you, I bless this house.<BR>\r\nWalk around the house saying the following in each room (including\r\nattic and cupboards):<BR>\r\nBe comforted. All is well. Now you are blessed. You have life\r\nto nurture and nurture you. <BR>\r\nBe calm. Be easy. Be comforted. You are blessed.<BR>\r\nIf you can identify the spirit, say the following in the room\r\nmost affected:<BR>\r\nIt is time to leave here. All is well. There is nothing here for\r\nyou. You must be gone. <BR>\r\nGo now, go, complete your passing. Go, and with our blessing and\r\nfarewell.<BR>\r\nOften commanding any evil spirits to leave at once, in the name\r\nof your deity three times works well. <BR>\r\nAfter this you could get a smudge stick of sage, or sage incense,\r\nand perform a house blessing <BR>\r\ncarrying it deosil around the property and from room to room,\r\npaying special attention to doorways, <BR>\r\ncrevices and windows, and also any places that `feel` cold. <BR>\r\nAs you do this with words from a house blessing, scatter salt\r\nand water which has been <BR>\r\nconsecrated and blessed. Have windows and doors open as you bless\r\nthe house. <BR>\r\nSalt scattered along windowsills and doorways will prevent any\r\nentity re-entering the property.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">HOUSE GUARDIANS<BR>\r\nHouse Guardians Supplies: <BR>\r\nRepresentations of your guardians for the number of doors in you\r\nhouse. <BR>\r\nIf you have a garage attached to your house, just use a representation\r\nfor the door in <BR>\r\nyour house to your garage unless someone spends a lot of time\r\nin the garage, then use <BR>\r\nit for the garage door. The representations can be anything you\'d\r\nlike pictures, statues, <BR>\r\nsome kind of craft, etc. Usually, it is best if you can hang the\r\nrepresentation by or across <BR>\r\nfrom the door, but it is not necessary. We have our house guardian\r\nstatues <BR>\r\n(two small gargoyles) sitting on top of a bookcase in the living\r\nroom. <BR>\r\nPutting them near the doors is just for your mind to reaffirm\r\nthat they are protecting the home, <BR>\r\nbut if you feel comfortable placing them somewhere else, then\r\ndo. <BR>\r\nA cleansed white candle for each guardian. <BR>\r\nA sage smudge stick or other cleansing incense like sandalwood\r\nor just sage in its raw form. <BR>\r\nBefore calling house guardians to guard your home, you should\r\ngive your home a good cleansing. <BR>\r\nTake the smudge stick (be sure you have a bowl to catch the ashes)\r\nand begin at the front door. <BR>\r\nLight the smudged and say a few words such as:<BR>\r\n&quot;As I walk this house May it be cleansed of all negativity&quot;<BR>\r\nStart walking around the house clockwise. <BR>\r\nCircle the smudge counter clockwise or just in a straight line\r\nin front of you towards the walls. <BR>\r\nFeel all negative energy flowing out, pushing it through the walls.<BR>\r\nWhen you come to a window, bar it by literally pulling the smudge\r\nstick back and forth over the <BR>\r\nwindow like you are tracing bars on it. Say something like:<BR>\r\n&quot;I bar this portal from allowing anything to enter&quot;<BR>\r\nIgnore inside doors, like doors to bedrooms. Go into all the rooms\r\nand bar all windows.<BR>\r\nWhen you come to an outside door, do not bar it. <BR>\r\nDraw a circle around the doorframe three times saying something\r\nlike:<BR>\r\n&quot;May no negative energies enter. If a negative person enters,<BR>\r\nMay they leave their Negativity outside&quot;<BR>\r\nIf you have stairs, when you come to them, go up and do the other\r\nfloor (s) then <BR>\r\ncome back down and finish the lower floor. <BR>\r\nYou should always end the cleansing right back where you started,\r\nat the front door. <BR>\r\nWhen you get back to the door, say a finalizing comment like:<BR>\r\n&quot;This house is cleansed. So mote it be&quot;<BR>\r\nIf you have a storage attic, one you can\'t climb into very well,\r\nbar the entrance to it and just <BR>\r\nmake sure that anyone who goes up there wears a protection amulet\r\nor has their shields up. <BR>\r\nNow take your house guardian representations and the candles to\r\nthe place your family spends <BR>\r\nmost of its time together. In most families, it is the dining\r\nroom table, or other place you eat your food. <BR>\r\nSet a candle before each representation. Now, spirits are everywhere\r\nin every house and you are <BR>\r\nsimply calling a few who would like to help protect your home.\r\nThat is why it is important to <BR>\r\ncleanse the house first so no unwanted spirits are there. Light\r\nthe first candle having in mind <BR>\r\nwhich door you want the guardian to protect. Say something like:<BR>\r\n&quot;I welcome a spirit of this house to Guard and protect all\r\nwho dwell here&quot;<BR>\r\nRepeat this with the other guardians if you have more than one.\r\nWhen you are done, take a <BR>\r\nmoment to meditate with them, then take them to their designated\r\npositions within the house <BR>\r\nand extinguish the candles. These candles are to be used only\r\nto call upon the guardians. <BR>\r\nYou should introduce the family, including all pets to the guardians.<BR>\r\nTo do this, light their candles and call them, always where you\r\ncalled upon them in the first place. <BR>\r\nThen introduce your family one at a time. If you have a spouse\r\nwho wishes not to participate, <BR>\r\nthen tell the guardians that s/he does belong in the house and\r\nto protect them as well. <BR>\r\nYou can call the guardians at any time in the above manner. It\r\nis also good to meditate with them. <BR>\r\nLight the candles, call them, then meditate and you will see and\r\nhear them. <BR>\r\nIt is a good idea to get to know them. On May Day, the Romans\r\nwould do a ritual for <BR>\r\ntheir house guardians. So on this day, do something extra special\r\nfor them. If you are <BR>\r\ngoing to have company for more than a few days, tell the guardians.\r\nThe guardians will <BR>\r\nthen protect them also. Always leave offerings out for the guardians\r\nwhen you call them, <BR>\r\nwhen you feel they have done something good for you, and on the\r\nSabbats and Esbats. <BR>\r\nThese offerings can be a small dish of left over food and drink\r\nfrom dinner. <BR>\r\nPut it in a place where pets and children cannot reach it. In\r\nthe morning, you will find the <BR>\r\nfood there, but the essence of the food, its nutrition and often\r\ntimes its taste, will be gone. <BR>\r\nAnytime you are going to do something different in the house,\r\ninform the guardians first. <BR>\r\nIf you are expecting a child, getting a new pet, redecorating,\r\nor just having a party, <BR>\r\ntell them out of respect so they are not wondering what is going\r\non! <BR>\r\nThe most important thing to remember about your guardians is that\r\nthey normally will <BR>\r\nstay in the house you called them in. If you move, tell them and\r\ntell them their services <BR>\r\nwill no longer be needed.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">AN HERBAL PROTECTION SPELL<BR>\r\nGet a piece of white cloth.

It should be glass\r\nbecause glass is made from sand. <BR>\r\nThoroughly wash and dry the jar, removing any labels. It must\r\nhave a close-fitting lid as well.<BR>\r\n* Equal quantities of two different colors of sand. Some types\r\ninclude fine grayish-white beach sand; <BR>\r\nyellowish coral sand; orangish sand from the desert; red sand\r\nfrom volcanic areas; black <BR>\r\nobsidian sand and many others. (Many of these can be bought at\r\nplant stores or pet stores. <BR>\r\nAlso try aquarium sops and builders to find different sand types.<BR>\r\nThey do not have to be beautiful just of differing types!)<BR>\r\n* A spoon. * Two small bowls to hold the sands.<BR>\r\nBefore you begin, pour one type of sand into the bottle until\r\nit\'s just over half filled. <BR>\r\nEmpty this sand into one dish. Call it &quot;Sand 1&quot; (for\r\nreference.) <BR>\r\nClean the bottle and repeat with &quot;Sand 2,&quot; emptying\r\nit into its own bowl. <BR>\r\nNow you are ready. Hold your protective hand over &quot;Sand 1.&quot;\r\nLook down at it. <BR>\r\nSee it humming and writhing with protective, projective energy.\r\nTouch the sand. <BR>\r\nVisualize it emitting sparks of bright white light that ensnare\r\nnegativity and draw it inward. <BR>\r\nCharge it with personal power. Repeat with &quot;Sand 2&quot;.\r\nPlace the bottle before you. <BR>\r\nScoop out a level spoonful of sand. Pour this into the jar while\r\nsaying the following words:<BR>\r\n&quot;Trap of sand Trap the ill.<BR>\r\nTrap the bane and Evil will.&quot;<BR>\r\nSo mote it be, it is done!</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">HOME BLESSING MAGICK<BR>\r\nA home blessing meditation for charging a room: <BR>\r\nSit Straight with palms on lap, take deep breaths, relax, and\r\nmove into a mental <BR>\r\nspace where you activate your intuitive senses, Imagine a cord\r\nof energy from <BR>\r\nyour spine connecting you to the Earth, and channel energy from\r\nthe Earth <BR>\r\nthrough it, Silently ask for divine protection, guidance, and\r\nblessing, Direct your <BR>\r\npsychic sensing outward, and feel lines of force coming out of\r\nyour aura, <BR>\r\nNote where the strongest energy is (check out the floor, ceiling,\r\ndirections, etc), <BR>\r\nNote spots that feel empty or dead, note places that feel full\r\nalive, focus on where <BR>\r\nyou are sitting and how you feel at that particular spot, Imagine\r\na sphere of light <BR>\r\nand love energy at your heart, feel it pulsing outward with every\r\nbreath. <BR>\r\nFeel the radiance increase with every breath, feel your self as\r\na star, continue to<BR>\r\nbreathe deeply and send out the energy, letting it pulsate in\r\nthe room, <BR>\r\nWhen ready, start making power sounds representing the love and\r\nlight you are channeling; <BR>\r\nuse it to amplify the light you are weaving; and fill the room\r\nwith the energy, Then shift focus to <BR>\r\nsending a probe out into the room, and note the differences in\r\nthe quality of energy and how <BR>\r\nyou feel about it, Repeat if necessary, When done, feel the completeness\r\nof the work. <BR>\r\nA room blessing involving elemental quarter invocations: <BR>\r\nFace each direction (with arms out in appropriate elemental invoking\r\ngesture), and say, <BR>\r\nwhile channeling and visualizing elemental power: <BR>\r\nPowers of (say direction), Powers of (say corresponding element),<BR>\r\nWe great you, we honor you, we welcome you here! <BR>\r\nWatch over and bless and protect this place.<BR>\r\nAfter each invocation, shape the energy into columns of light\r\nby sweeping ones <BR>\r\narms together until they are parallel and sweeping them up and\r\ndown while <BR>\r\nchanneling and shaping the energy, when the energy is properly\r\nshaped; say So mote it be. <BR>\r\nAfter you have done all four quarters, channel in spirit energy.<BR>\r\nTo return the energy to a more mellow state while energizing yourself,<BR>\r\nput your hands out and take in a bit of the energy into your self\r\nfrom each direction, <BR>\r\ngoing widdershins, hold hands to your heart and take in the energy\r\n(techniques <BR>\r\nalso exist for bringing it into a stone and retrieving it when\r\nneeded).</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">HOUSE BLESSING<BR>\r\nSalt &amp; Water Incense (fire and air) Milk &amp; Honey Oil (for\r\nanointing)<BR>\r\nWine (for offering) Bells, Pots, Pans, Whistles, etc.<BR>\r\nCast a circle in the main room (living room) and after casting,\r\nvisualize the circle <BR>\r\nexpanding to include the entire house.

A basic fire\r\nincense recipe contains:<BR>\r\n4 parts frankincense 3 parts cinnamon 1 part dried orange peels\r\n1/4 part thyme<BR>\r\nOther fire-related herbs and plants include allspice, basil, bay,\r\nblack pepper, clove, cumin,<BR>\r\ndill, garlic, ginger, nutmeg, onions, and thistle.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">AIR INCENSE<BR>\r\nAir is the other masculine element and it is usually associated\r\nwith east.<BR>\r\nAreas governed by this element are education, communication, weather\r\nmagic,<BR>\r\ngeneral power raising, and music magic. The following combination\r\nmakes a basic air incense:<BR>\r\n4 parts rosemary 2 parts mugwort 1 part chicory 1/2 part coffee\r\nbeans<BR>\r\nOther air-related herbs and plants include benzoin, elm bark,\r\nlavender, parsley, sage, spearmint</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">INCENSE<BR>\r\nThere are basically two forms of incense: combustible and noncombustible.<BR>\r\nWe\'ll tackle the latter first, since it\'s by far the easiest method\r\nand requires little explanation.<BR>\r\nNoncombustible incense is achieved by simply sprinkling a few\r\npinches of dried plant material,<BR>\r\nor a blend of materials, on a smoldering charcoal block. That\'s\r\na charcoal block, not a charcoal<BR>\r\nbriquette used for the barbecue! Briquettes are of different composition,\r\nand give off toxic amounts<BR>\r\nof carbon monoxide. Don\'t use them to burn incense! Instead, occult\r\nsupply stores, and many<BR>\r\nnovelty shops carry a supply of raw charcoal blocks for this purpose.<BR>\r\nWhile we\'re in a cautious mode, let it be said that you should\r\nalways burn incense in some type<BR>\r\nof censor. It could be a censor purchased just for this purpose,\r\nor a ceramic dish laid with a few<BR>\r\ninches of sand or salt. Sometimes the sweet aroma of dried plant\r\nmaterial can change dramatically<BR>\r\nwhen burned! You\'ll need to experiment with blends you may already\r\nhave in mind, or to discover<BR>\r\nnew ones. And, by using the noncombustible method, your mistakes,\r\nif any, will be short lived.<BR>\r\nI would also advise that you sample mixtures on smoldering charcoal\r\nbefore proceeding to making<BR>\r\nthem into combustible incense. The plant material to be used should\r\nbe finely ground in a food<BR>\r\nprocessor, blender, hand held coffee grinder, or an old fashioned\r\nmortar and pestle.<BR>\r\nCombustible incense is made in the form of sticks (sometimes called\r\njoss-sticks), bricks, or cones.<BR>\r\nWhatever the volume and shape, combustible incense is always made\r\nwith potassium nitrate,<BR>\r\nbetter known as salt peter. This helps the incense to burn well,\r\nand evenly. You can find potassium<BR>\r\nnitrate in nearly any drug store, although you may have to ask\r\nthe pharmacist for it.<BR>\r\nYou will need thin wooden splints or skewers, such as thin, straight\r\ntwigs, or cocktail skewers.<BR>\r\nEach stick is dipped into the incense base until covered. They\r\nare then allowed to dry standing<BR>\r\non end, perhaps by poking them into a slab of clay, or a pot of\r\ndirt or sand. This process is<BR>\r\nrepeated until a satisfactory amount of layers have built up on\r\neach stick.<BR>\r\nBlock incense is made by rolling out the final mixture on wax\r\npaper to a 1/4 inch thickness -<BR>\r\nmuch like cookie dough. Then cut into 1 inch squares and allow\r\nto dry thoroughly.<BR>\r\nAnd there you have it! Not so tough, although you will get good\r\nuse from a kitchen apron<BR>\r\nwhile working the mixtures together! Now, on to some recommended\r\nblends, the first of<BR>\r\nwhich is an ancient blend indeed.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">KYPHI INCENSE<BR>\r\nKyphi is an ancient Egyptian formula of which the Greek Essayist,\r\nPlutarch (46-120 AD) said:<BR>\r\n&quot;its aromatic substances lull to sleep, allay anxieties,\r\nand brighten the dreams. It is made of<BR>\r\nthings that delight most in the night and exhibits its virtues\r\nby night.&quot;<BR>\r\nThe following is a traditional recipe for making Kyphi. If you\r\nwant to stick to it fine, but you<BR>\r\nmay also omit or substitute certain herbs if some of the ingredients\r\nare difficult to obtain.<BR>\r\nPlace 1/4 cup raisins in a bowl. Add just enough white wine to\r\ncover the raisins, cover<BR>\r\nloosely with a tea towel or cheesecloth, and allow to steep for\r\nseven days.<BR>\r\nOn the third day, blend equal parts of the following powdered\r\nherbs in a bit of white wine: Juniper,<BR>\r\nAcacia, Henna, Sweet Sedge Root. After two days drain and reserve\r\nany liquid.<BR>\r\nOn the last day, drain the raisin mixture, reserving the liquid.\r\nIn a small bowl mix together equal<BR>\r\nparts of the following ground herbs: Calamus, Gum Mastic, Peppermint,\r\nBay Laurel, Orris,<BR>\r\nCinnamon, and Galangal. Set aside. In another small bowl blend\r\ntogether<BR>\r\n1 tbls. powdered myrrh, and 1 tbls. clove honey. To this mixture\r\nadd the ground herbs,<BR>\r\nand the raisins and herbs steeped in wine. Blend well. Add a little\r\nof the reserved wine if<BR>\r\nthe mixture becomes too dry. Follow the directions for making\r\ncone or block incense.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">FULL MOON INCENSE<BR>\r\nThis incense is used in many rituals and is a common spell component.<BR>\r\nIt is an incense of increase that is deceivingly easy to make.<BR>\r\nUse all of your focus and energy, your will and intention, while\r\nmaking this scent.<BR>\r\nIt is used over charcoals (the one\'s specifically made for incense)\r\nor over a ritual fire.<BR>\r\nCAUTION! Warning and Yikes! If used over a ritual fire, flames\r\nwill leap up along the<BR>\r\ndust trail of this incense powder! There will be sparkling (sparks)\r\nof incense outside<BR>\r\nof this trail of flames as well! This is an impressive effect,\r\nbut dangerous if you are<BR>\r\nnot practiced at it! Start out small and toss about 1 teaspoon\r\nof it over the glowing<BR>\r\ncoals or flames, all at once, don\'t trail the dust or sprinkle\r\nit. Stand away from the fire,<BR>\r\nand upwind. Use in areas that do not require burn permits, and\r\nhave something to<BR>\r\ndouse the fire nearby. Do not use if you are wearing gauzy or\r\nloose ritual robes and costumes.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">FULL MOON INCENSE<BR>\r\nWithin the three days prior to the actual full moon, but not after!\r\nGather the ingredients<BR>\r\nrequired, along with a pestle and mortar to<BR>\r\nblend them in. If desired, you can use your cauldron, and some\r\nsort of crushing or mixing tool.<BR>\r\n1 ounce (about 30 grams) of the finest sandalwood powder you can\r\nfind (santalum album)<BR>\r\n5 grams (a marble sized nugget) of amber resin, NOT the stone!\r\nThe soft, sweet<BR>\r\nsmelling resin that is often imported from India, available at\r\nhealth food stores,<BR>\r\nand of course herb and Witch shops.<BR>\r\n3 drops of vanilla essential oil. NOT the perfume or fragrance\r\noil, only<BR>\r\ntrue vanilla from the orchid (Vanilla planifolia or Vanilla aromatica)\r\nIf this is cost<BR>\r\nprohibitive or unavailable, use real vanilla extract<BR>\r\navailable at most any grocery store. Preferably outside, under\r\nthe actual full moon,<BR>\r\nor indoors near a window where the moon is visible:<BR>\r\nFill the mortar or cauldron with the sandalwood powder, and crush\r\nthe amber<BR>\r\ninto it with the pestle or tool of your choice. Use clockwise\r\nor deosil blending motions.<BR>\r\nFocus on the energy of the full moon, or if you are making the\r\nincense for a specific spell,<BR>\r\nfocus on the goal of that spell alone. You can incorporate your\r\nfavorite words of power or<BR>\r\nchant while doing this. When the powder is smooth and consistent,\r\nadd the vanilla, one<BR>\r\ndrop at a time while saying your chosen words of power, (which\r\nis best) or the following<BR>\r\n(which will suffice in most cases): Drop of moon, grant my boon.<BR>\r\nBlend in the drops in the same way you blended in the amber resin.\r\nPlace the mixture in<BR>\r\na clear glass jar with an airtight lid. Keep it away from heat,\r\nsunlight, and moisture.<BR>\r\nCharge it under the light of the full moon on the three days prior\r\nto it becoming actually full.<BR>\r\nThe full moon light penetration is the reason for not storing\r\nthis in an opaque jar.<BR>\r\nIt is ready for use immediately, but can be charged more if desired.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">INCENSE<BR>\r\nGum tragacanth (or use gum Arabic as a substitute) is made into\r\na glue, and acts as a binding agent.<BR>\r\nIt is the key ingredient in all molded incense. To make the glue,\r\nplace a teaspoon of the ground gum<BR>\r\nin a glass of warm water and mix completely until dispersed. A\r\nfoam may rise, but it can be easily<BR>\r\nredistributed, or skimmed off if it gets in your way. (The gum\r\nis unbelievably absorbent! A mere<BR>\r\nounce will absorb up to one full gallon of water in a single week!)\r\nAllow your gum mixture to<BR>\r\nabsorb the glass of water until it thickens to a paste.<BR>\r\nNow you will need to create your incense base. An incense base\r\nis made up of talcum powder,<BR>\r\nsawdust, ground spice, dried herbs and flowers, or any combination\r\nthereof. Once you have<BR>\r\ndefined your base, an essential oil may be added for additional\r\nscent, the potassium nitrate<BR>\r\nis blended in, and finally, the gum-glue.<BR>\r\nHere\'s a sample mixture for cone incense:<BR>\r\n--6 parts powdered sandalwood or cedar 2 parts benzoin 1 part\r\norris root<BR>\r\n--3-5 parts ground herb mixture of choice 6 drops essential herbal\r\noil of choice<BR>\r\nMix the first four ingredients until well blended. Add the essential\r\noil (or combination of oils) and<BR>\r\nmix with your hands until you have a fine, crumbly mixture. Add\r\nthe dried herb mixture and<BR>\r\nmix again. Now add 10% potassium nitrate (KNO3). In other words,\r\nuse a ratio of 10:1.<BR>\r\nIf you\'ve made 10 oz. of incense base, then add 1 oz. of KNO3.<BR>\r\nNext comes the addition of the glue mixture. Add one teaspoon\r\nat a time, mixing with your<BR>\r\nhands as you go. Add only enough of the glue to achieve the consistency\r\nof model clay<BR>\r\nor play dough from the entire mixture.<BR>\r\nOn a piece of waxed paper, shape the mixture into small cone shapes\r\n(just like the store bought<BR>\r\nones you\'re already familiar with) and allow them to dry for a\r\nweek in a cool, dry place. The area<BR>\r\nyou choose to dry the incense cones in must be free of moisture\r\nin order to dry thoroughly.<BR>\r\nBy following the sample recipe given, you can also make stick\r\nincense.<BR>\r\nAlthough, this requires much more patience and tenacity than making\r\nany other form.<BR>\r\nPlan to spend the better part of a day in making these.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">KITCHEN WHITCHEN<BR>\r\nHouse blessing Incense<BR>\r\n2 Tab. dry lemon peel 1 Tab.

Get everyone else who\r\nwants the same outcome<BR>\r\nto also keep thinking about blue justice. If the attorney or prosecutor\r\nwho represents your<BR>\r\ninterest is open to such a thing, tell her or him to think \'blue\r\njustice\' every time the case seems<BR>\r\nto be going against them. Dress in blue if you attend the trial.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">HOODOO COURT SPELL<BR>\r\nIf someone has a court case against you or threatens you with\r\none, the classic hoodoo<BR>\r\nspell is to silence them.<BR>\r\nTo do this, get a beef tongue from the butcher and nine sewing\r\nneedles.<BR>\r\nWrite the person\'s full name nine times on a piece of paper (which\r\npiece of paper can be a photo<BR>\r\nof them, if you have one). If you know their birthdate, add that\r\ntoo. Turn the paper 90 degrees<BR>\r\nand write your name crossing and covering their name nine times,\r\nand as you do so, say, nine times:<BR>\r\n[Name], I cross and cover you.<BR>\r\nCome under my command.<BR>\r\nI command you to hold your tongue.<BR>\r\nFold the paper toward you to draw you wish in, then turn and fold\r\nit toward you again.<BR>\r\nSlit the beef tongue open with a horizontal cut, just big enough\r\nto put the folded paper in.<BR>\r\nUsing the nine needles, stitch the tongue shut again. Cover the\r\ntongue in red pepper powder,<BR>\r\nblack pepper powder, and salt. Now, at this point, different folks\r\ndo different things with the tongue.<BR>\r\nA very old African-American tradition is to get a brown candle,\r\ndress it with Court Case Oil and light it,<BR>\r\nthen while it burns put the beef tongue into a pot of water with\r\nred beans, a chopped onion, salt, and<BR>\r\ncayenne pepper, and cook it up. If the matter is going before\r\na judge, and the person you want to<BR>\r\nsilence is a witness, you can put it on to cook while court is\r\nin session. If someone is threatening to sue,<BR>\r\nyou cook it any time. If you use small offertory candles. keep\r\nthem burning the entire time the tongue is<BR>\r\ncooking, lighting each one from the last. Or use brown 7-day candle,\r\nwhich will stay alight the entire time.<BR>\r\nWhen the tongue is done cooking and the beans are ready to eat,\r\nyou serve it up and eat it.<BR>\r\nAnd that means eating the paper, too. You are symbolically swallowing\r\nthe other person\'s ability to speak.<BR>\r\nBe careful not to swallow the needles. Put them aside and after\r\nyour dinner of hot stewed tongue,<BR>\r\ncarry them to a crossroads, throw them over your left shoulder\r\nand walk home without looking back.<BR>\r\nSome urban hoodoo practitioners like to put the prepared beef\r\ntongue, uncooked, in the freezer,<BR>\r\nfreezing; the person\'s tongue. This is a modern idea, obviously,\r\nbecause freezers were only<BR>\r\ninvented in the 20th century, but it has great symbolism on its\r\nbehalf. Santeria practitioners<BR>\r\nuse the same African-derived beef tongue ritual, but they are\r\nlikely to place the uncooked<BR>\r\ntongue on the accuser\'s or witness\'s doorstep as a warning, decorating\r\nit with cayenne<BR>\r\npepper to make it hot for the potential speaker.<BR>\r\nThey may also light three brown candles dressed with Court Case\r\nOil around the tongue for the<BR>\r\nperson to find when they open their door.<BR>\r\nTo protect against slander, gossip, and false accusations, carry\r\na pinch of slippery elm bark<BR>\r\nchips in your conjure bag.<BR>\r\nSome folks also put a pinch of powdered slippery elmbark into\r\ntheir sewed-tongue stew, too; it is<BR>\r\nperfectly edible and acts as a thickener, like file gumbo. In\r\nthe case that the matter cannot be<BR>\r\nresolved and goes to court, carry Deer\'s Tongue Leaves for your\r\nlawyer\'s eloquence, Calendula<BR>\r\nFlowers for winning in court, and use Little John to Chew (also\r\nknown as Galangal or Court<BR>\r\nCaseRoot) to chew while you are in court so that the judge will\r\nfavor you.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">CANDLE SPELL FOR JUSTICE OR HELP IN LEGAL MATTERS<BR>\r\nIt does not require a sword only Tarot and candles.<BR>\r\nYou might want to burn some herbs or incense associated with justice\r\nwhile doing this spell.<BR>\r\nAlso a simple yet incredibly powerful protection spell is done\r\nwith a small or medium sized<BR>\r\nmirror you can hold in your hands.<BR>\r\nWhile holding the mirror facing outwards in other words not showing\r\nyour reflection but<BR>\r\nturned to reflect out, turn in a counter clockwise circle to banish\r\nwhile saying:<BR>\r\nCircle of reflection, Circle of protection,<BR>\r\nMay the sender of all harm, Feel the power of this charm.<BR>\r\nThis does not send any negative energy at the sender hence eliminating\r\nthe cause<BR>\r\nand effect portion of negativity adding to negativity but it reflects\r\nback anything being<BR>\r\ndirected at you. So it bounces off you instead of affecting you.<BR>\r\nCircle three times full round chanting this or until you feel\r\nit is complete, then make<BR>\r\na closing statement such as: So Be It</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">DAY IN COURT WASH<BR>\r\nThree days before your scheduled court appearance, make this wash.<BR>\r\nPut the bottle in a consecrated dark place.<BR>\r\nOn the morning of the court date, pour this mixture out of your\r\nfront door where you<BR>\r\nmust walk through it when you leave the house on your way to court.<BR>\r\nCarry a large piece of High John the Conqueror root in your pocket\r\nto the courtroom.<BR>\r\nTo one pint of fresh water add 1/4 oz jalop powder, 3/4 oz of\r\nsnake head<BR>\r\nand 1 tsp. of blessed salt.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">WIN AT LAW SPELL<BR>\r\nPerform this Spell at midnight before any court appearance.<BR>\r\nPlace papers associated with your legal battle on your altar.\r\nPlace a candle to the right of them.<BR>\r\nAt exactly midnight light the candle. As the candle burns brightly,\r\nstudy the flame closely.<BR>\r\nWhen it is burning brightly, clearly and steadily, stare into\r\nthe flame.<BR>\r\nPlace your writing hand on the papers and visualize the result\r\nthat is wanted. Then Say:<BR>\r\n&quot;Rash Of Mithra, Hear Me!&quot;<BR>\r\n&quot;My Cause Is Right and True&quot;<BR>\r\n&quot;Influence the Powers That Judge&quot;<BR>\r\n&quot;I Ask This Boon Of You.&quot;<BR>\r\nWalk 3 circles to the right, sit down again, lay your hand on\r\nthe papers and stare into the flame.<BR>\r\nThe flame will be moving.

Next, make\r\nholes in both sides of the shell<BR>\r\nwith a small nail. If desired, pattern the holes symbolically\r\nor use a specific number to enhance<BR>\r\nmeaning. Set the halves aside to dry. Meanwhile, find a disposable\r\nrepresentation of your<BR>\r\nfrustration. Also gather a piece of white paper or cloth, some\r\ndried mint, white ribbon and glue.<BR>\r\nSit before your image of frustration and pour all your feelings\r\ninto it. It may help to visualize or<BR>\r\nre-enact the situation that induced those feelings. Cry or shout\r\nuntil a sense of quiet emptiness<BR>\r\nsettles over you.<BR>\r\nThen, wrap the emblem up in white, saying,<BR>\r\n&quot;I cover you with peace, harmony, and understanding.<BR>\r\nI accept peace to my own heart and extend it to ____.<BR>\r\nWhere frustration was born, let love replace it.&quot;<BR>\r\nNow, inside one half of the coconut shell, lay the cloth and emblem,\r\ncompletely surrounding<BR>\r\nthem with mint (to encircle it with calm energy).

Finally, use the white ribbon of truce as adornment.<BR>\r\nHang the coconut somewhere so the winds can release their serene\r\nenergy into your space.<BR>\r\nIf the coconut ever &quot;goes bad,&quot; bury it with your negativity.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">SPELL TO STOP SOMEONE FROM STEALING<BR>\r\nDo this spell on a Saturday ruled by Saturn and good for Justice\r\nspells<BR>\r\nYou will need: a black candle pin olive oil sea salt candle holder<BR>\r\nCarve the person\'s name on the candle using the pin - or if you\r\ndon\'t know their name, carve \'thief\'.<BR>\r\nMix a good handful of salt with a cup of olive oil and allow the\r\ncandle to soak in it for three hours.<BR>\r\nTake the candle, wipe it down and carve out the bottom so the\r\nwick is exposed.<BR>\r\nStand the candle on it\'s head and light the bottom wick - gaze\r\nat the flame, concentrate and say:<BR>\r\n&quot;Thief your deeds are no longer tolerated<BR>\r\nIt\'s time for you to stop this behavior.<BR>\r\nBy my will you shall cease<BR>\r\nand restore in me a sense of peace.&quot;<BR>\r\nLet the candle burn out and if you can bury the stub near where\r\nthe person lives or<BR>\r\nwhere they most commonly commit their crime - otherwise bury under\r\na tree.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">9/6/01</FONT>\r\n\r\n</BODY>',

In its symbolic or token form, it may be\r\ncalled a ritual of gender, of<BR>\r\nmale-female polarity but not involving intercourse. To avoid misunderstandings,\r\nI must<BR>\r\nemphasize that to the Witch, sex is holy-- an unashamed and beautiful\r\npolarity-force which is<BR>\r\nintrinsic to the nature of the universe. It is to be treated with\r\nreverence, but without prudery.<BR>\r\nThe Craft makes no apology for using intercourse between an appropriate\r\nman and woman<BR>\r\n(i.e.: the High Priestess and High Priest of a coven), in private,\r\nas a profound ritual sacrament,<BR>\r\nbringing in all the levels-- physical, astral, mental, and spiritual.<BR>\r\nIn the ritual, the body of the Priestess is regarded as the Altar\r\nof the Goddess whom she<BR>\r\nrepresents, and for whom she is the channel. Her womb is revered\r\nas the &quot;fount of life without<BR>\r\nwhich we would not be&quot; and no apology is needed for this\r\nancient and holy symbolism either.<BR>\r\nThe question, of course, would be &quot;who are the appropriate\r\nman and woman&quot; to enact<BR>\r\nthe &quot;actual&quot; Great Rite instead of the symbolic one?\r\nIt should only be a man and a woman<BR>\r\nfor whom intercourse is already a normal and loving part of their\r\nrelationship; in other words,<BR>\r\nhusband and wife, or established lovers. And it should always\r\nbe enacted in private.<BR>\r\nWicca is unashamed, but not promiscuous or voyeuristic.<BR>\r\nThe &quot;symbolic&quot; Great Rite shouldn\'t be viewed as makeshift\r\nof ineffectual. It can be a powerful<BR>\r\nand moving rite, when sincerely worked by two harmonious friends\r\nwho are not lovers. It, too,<BR>\r\ninvokes all the levels, but in a way which a mature Brother and\r\nSister of the Craft are well able to handle.<BR>\r\nIn Witchcraft, sex is a sacrament, an outward sign of inward grace.\r\nThat grace is the deep<BR>\r\nconnection and recognition of the wholeness of another person.\r\nIn its essence, it is not limited<BR>\r\nto the physical act-- it is an exchange of energy, of subtle nourishment,\r\nbetween people.<BR>\r\nThrough connection with another, we connect with the all.<BR>\r\nIf you choose to include a symbolic Great Rite in your ritual\r\nyou may use the water chalice<BR>\r\nas the symbol of the woman and the athame as the symbol of the\r\nman; the man holds the<BR>\r\nathame and dips it into the chalice- symbolic of intercourse.<BR>\r\nDo all appropriate consecration, banishing and evocation rituals\r\nto sanctify the area, dispel all<BR>\r\nnegative energies and conserve all energies manifest in the ceremony.\r\nDraw the sacred circle<BR>\r\nand setup your four directional gates.<BR>\r\nIncorporate all elements to boost the lunar/sexual energy.<BR>\r\nSet up your altar to soak in full moon beams, light the candles\r\nand incense or bonfire (if outside)<BR>\r\nand give praise to the Deity you will be drawing down energy from\r\nand also give awe and<BR>\r\nreverence to all parties involved in the ritual.

One<BR>\r\nof the best ways that I have found to do this is to take a ritual\r\nbath.<BR>\r\ntwo purposes -- one, it relaxes you and gives you time to meditate\r\non<BR>\r\nthe spell that you are about to perform, and two, if you throw\r\na<BR>\r\ntablespoon of sea salts into the water, it offers protection.\r\nAfter you have<BR>\r\ntaken your ritual bath, you may begin your spell. Begin by lighting\r\nan<BR>\r\nincense stick or cone. Next, take one of the pink candles and<BR>\r\nhold it in your hands. Visualize your need -- your desire to find\r\ntrue love.<BR>\r\nNext anoint your candle with the oil that you have chosen. This\r\nis done by<BR>\r\nplacing a little of the oil on your fingertips. Grasp the candle\r\nat its<BR>\r\nmidpoint with your left index finger and thumb, and use your right\r\nindex<BR>\r\nfinger and thumb to stroke oil on the candle from the midpoint\r\nup to the top<BR>\r\nof the candle. Next, grasp the candle at its midpoint with your\r\nright index<BR>\r\nfinger and thumb, and use your left index finger and thumb to\r\nstroke oil on<BR>\r\nthe candle from the midpoint down to the bottom of the candle.\r\nContinue in<BR>\r\nthis fashion until the entire candle has been anointed. While\r\nritually<BR>\r\nanointing your candle, visualize a pure white beam of light coming\r\nup from<BR>\r\nMother Earth, entering your body through the soles of your feet\r\nand another<BR>\r\nbeam of white light coming down from the Universe and entering\r\nyour body<BR>\r\nthrough the top of your head. Envision the energy of these beams\r\nof light<BR>\r\nflowing throughout your body and mingling together, finally concentrating\r\nin<BR>\r\nyour hands, causing them to feel warm and to tingle. Now continue\r\nto stroke<BR>\r\nyour candle until you feel the energy from your hands transfer\r\nto the<BR>\r\ncandle. Your candle is now charged with your personal energy and\r\nmagical<BR>\r\nintent. Pick up the next pink candle and hold it in your hands.\r\nVisualize<BR>\r\nthe man or woman that you desire (not a specific person -- just\r\nthe type of<BR>\r\nperson you desire). Think about the traits that you are looking\r\nfor in a<BR>\r\nmate. After you have finished your visualization, anoint the candle\r\n(as<BR>\r\nabove). Place the two pink candles in holders on your altar. Place\r\nthe rose<BR>\r\nquartz in between the two candle holders. Encircle the two candle\r\nholders<BR>\r\nwith the nine rose buds. Light the two candles and visualize yourself\r\nin a<BR>\r\nloving relationship with the perfect mate. Continue this visualization\r\nas<BR>\r\nlong as possible. Allow your candles to burn down completely.\r\nKeep one of<BR>\r\nthe rose buds and your rose quartz to carry with you in your purse\r\nor pocket<BR>\r\nto reinforce your magical intention. Scatter the eight remaining\r\nrose buds<BR>\r\nto the four corners of the wind, as an offering. Know that the\r\nPowers of the<BR>\r\nUniverse are now working on your behalf to manifest your desired\r\nresult.<BR>\r\nThink no more of it.

Music that invokes\r\nsensuality and<BR>\r\nclothing which makes you feel attractive are helpful tools. You\r\nmay begin by casting<BR>\r\na circle and/or invoking the Four Elements.<BR>\r\nBegin by invoking the Sex Goddess of your choice. I call upon\r\nFreya, the Norse cat sex Goddess.<BR>\r\nI invoke Her with the following words.<BR>\r\nI call upon you, Freya,<BR>\r\nGoddess of sensual delight and abundance<BR>\r\nshow me the beauty of my body<BR>\r\nhelp me to hear your beauty<BR>\r\nsmell your beauty<BR>\r\ntaste your beauty<BR>\r\nfeel your beauty<BR>\r\nfrom my toes to my head.<BR>\r\nShow me the wonders of your world<BR>\r\nhelp me grow in beauty<BR>\r\nand manifest my desire<BR>\r\nfrom the earth to the sky.<BR>\r\nDance a little to the music; imagine you are a tree, waving your\r\nlimbs in the wind,<BR>\r\nfeeling the earth on your toes.

Imagine yourself as the beast that\r\nyou are; sniff<BR>\r\nyour partner or yourself; make the sounds you imagine you would\r\nmake while rutting. Let yourself go!<BR>\r\nIf your ritual involves either masturbation or intercourse, try\r\nusing your orgasm as a magical tool.<BR>\r\nDuring orgasm, imagine yourself becoming the person that you want\r\nto be, achieving the lifestyle<BR>\r\nyou want, or transforming your environment. The energy you release\r\nthrough your bodily sensations<BR>\r\nis then freed to go out into the earth body and make the changes\r\nyou desire.<BR>\r\nWhen you feel satisfied, with or without orgasm, lie still on\r\nthe ground. Breathe deeply and feel your<BR>\r\nblood flowing through your limbs. Slowly stand and thank the Goddess.\r\nI like to say:<BR>\r\nMy pleasure is power,<BR>\r\nMy body a cup,<BR>\r\nOh, Great Goddess,<BR>\r\nYou fill me up!<BR>\r\nYou may then thank the elements and close the circle.<BR>\r\nInvoking a sex goddess charges your magical work. Lately I have\r\ninvoked Freya in my masturbatory<BR>\r\njourneys with interesting results. Freya\'s familiars are cats,\r\nand I have discovered that I am cat-like in<BR>\r\nmy sexuality as well! For example, I love to be stroked, but am\r\nskittish and often need to be solitary.<BR>\r\nWhen the moon is full and my tides rush in, I pounce! Freya was\r\nalso mocked at a feast of the gods<BR>\r\nin Asgard for making love to goats and pigs - a woman after my\r\nown fantasies!<BR>\r\nThe Goddess has consecrated my initiation into sex magic; through\r\nmy skin, muscles, and hair She<BR>\r\nhas helped me to let go of my inhibitions, my fear of what other\r\npeople might think, my worry and pain.<BR>\r\nIf you let go into your animal-self, you never know what might\r\nhappen. you might begin to eat joyously<BR>\r\nand ravenously, or bark hoarsely in the rain. Or you may feel\r\na sudden desire for that maple tree in your<BR>\r\nbackyard. Or, you may simply enjoy sex as the Great Mother intended:\r\nas a celebration of creation.<BR>\r\nIn all beginnings She is present.

If you have\r\na secret name that you use, inscribe that as well.<BR>\r\nNext, take the parchment paper and the pen. On this parchment\r\nyou will write all the qualities you<BR>\r\nwant in a potential lover or mate. For example: good listener,\r\nblue eyes, patient, good singing voice<BR>\r\nor musical ability, dances well, etc. Write whatever you really\r\nwould want - and give this some<BR>\r\ncareful thought. Write everything down on the parchment paper.\r\n(&quot;Likes to clean house and do<BR>\r\nthe dishes&quot; is good to ask for too!)<BR>\r\nDO NOT WRITE ANY ONE PERSON\'S NAME!!!<BR>\r\nEven if you are sure that this person fits the description to\r\na tee, you do not have the right to<BR>\r\nimpose your will on them.

Impress upon your mind these\r\nqualities which you are<BR>\r\nseeking in a lover. At this time also, feel your need for this\r\nlover, let your secret desires<BR>\r\ncome forth and feel them. Send the energy of these desires to\r\nthe candle, and thus to<BR>\r\nthe Goddesses. You can dance to raise energy, and you can dance\r\nerotically also to<BR>\r\nraise your own desires. You may also touch yourself, and please\r\nyourself at this time,<BR>\r\nas you might imagine a lover would please you and touch you. Do\r\nwhatever you feel<BR>\r\nyou want to do and are comfortable doing. Allow the candle to\r\ncontinue burning during this time.<BR>\r\nWhen you are ready to end the ritual, the last thing you will\r\nburn is the parchment paper<BR>\r\ndescribing the qualities you want in a lover. Read it over one\r\nlast time, and then consign<BR>\r\nit to the candle\'s flame. Let it burn completely. (Drop it into\r\nan ashtray or flame proof container<BR>\r\nto burn it safely.)<BR>\r\nThe candle needs to be burned out completely, you don\'t have to\r\nstay right there with it the<BR>\r\nwhole time, just make sure it can burn safely. Take the ashes\r\nfrom the parchment when you<BR>\r\nare finished, and allow the wind to take them away out of your\r\nhand, or you can scatter them<BR>\r\nin a moving river or stream. To finish the ritual, you should\r\nwear the oil you used everyday until<BR>\r\nthe Full Moon.<BR>\r\nBe sure to be open to meeting new people, especially during the\r\nnext two weeks to three<BR>\r\nmonth period.

Next, take one of the pink candles and\r\nhold it in your hands.<BR>\r\nVisualize your need -- your desire to find true love. Next anoint\r\nyour candle with the<BR>\r\noil that you have chosen. This is done by placing a little of\r\nthe oil on your fingertips.<BR>\r\nGrasp the candle at its midpoint with your left index finger and\r\nthumb, and use your<BR>\r\nright index finger and thumb to stroke oil on the candle from\r\nthe midpoint up to the<BR>\r\ntop of the candle. Next, grasp the candle at its midpoint with\r\nyour right index finger<BR>\r\nand thumb, and use your left index finger and thumb to stroke\r\noil on the candle from<BR>\r\nthe midpoint down to the bottom of the candle. Continue in this\r\nfashion until the<BR>\r\nentire candle has been anointed. While ritually anointing your\r\ncandle, visualize a pure<BR>\r\nwhite beam of light coming up from Mother Earth, entering your\r\nbody through the soles<BR>\r\nof your feet and another beam of white light coming down from\r\nthe Universe and entering<BR>\r\nyour body through the top of your head. Envision the energy of\r\nthese beams of light flowing<BR>\r\nthroughout your body and mingling together, finally concentrating\r\nin your hands, causing<BR>\r\nthem to feel warm and to tingle. Now continue to stroke your candle\r\nuntil you feel the<BR>\r\nenergy from your hands transfer to the candle. Your candle is\r\nnow charged with your<BR>\r\npersonal energy and magical intent. Pick up the next pink candle\r\nand hold it in your hands.<BR>\r\nVisualize the man or woman that you desire (not a specific person\r\n-- just the type of person<BR>\r\nyou desire). Think about the traits that you are looking for in\r\na mate. After you have finished<BR>\r\nyour visualization, anoint the candle (as above). Place the two\r\npink candles in holders on<BR>\r\nyour altar. Place the rose quartz in between the two candle holders.\r\nEncircle the two candle<BR>\r\nholders with the nine rose buds.

End\r\nthe rite but keep a small shield of<BR>\r\nprotection and focus around the altar (which you may already do).\r\nWhen the mass is dry,<BR>\r\nput it in a cloth, mojo bag, necklace, medicine bag, whatever\r\nyou wish that you can carry it<BR>\r\neasily for the next two weeks. Keep it near you when sleeping\r\ntoo, and for Goddess\'s sake,<BR>\r\ngo out and place yourself in situations where the spell can work!\r\nNo one is going to cross<BR>\r\nyour path if you are in your broom closet 24 hours a day, or in\r\nfront of the T.V. Because of<BR>\r\nthe manipulative nature of this spell, (a person is named and\r\nthose silver threads of fate are<BR>\r\nmessed with) it is recommended that if you are going to do this\r\nworking, place a free will<BR>\r\nnotice at the end. Something like:<BR>\r\nFree will remains despite this spell,<BR>\r\nI send (person\'s name) love and wish her/him well.<BR>\r\nThis spell will harm none, and never turn on me.<BR>\r\nthis is my will, so mote it be!</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">SPELL FOR SENDING A MESSAGE OF LOVE<BR>\r\nThis spell is a seven day spell performed 3 days before the full\r\nmoon, the day of the full moon, and 3 days hence.<BR>\r\nMaterials Needed: 1 Red Candle (a small taper will do) Rose Incense\r\nRose Water Your &quot;working&quot; knife<BR>\r\nMatches (or a lighter for modern pagans)<BR>\r\nLove is a passion that burns within the heart and mind, thus the\r\nred candle, red being a symbol of Fire,<BR>\r\npassion, desire. A rose is commonly given by one in love as a\r\nsymbol of feelings towards the intended.<BR>\r\nFind a quiet place to perform this spell, as complete concentration\r\nis necessary. If you have a sacred<BR>\r\nplace defined in your household, this will work best. While in\r\nthis space, face South, as this is the<BR>\r\nQuarter for the Element of Fire. Clear your mind and focus on\r\nyour work. On the first day of the spell,<BR>\r\nanoint the candle with rose water making it a tool through which\r\nyour message will be delivered.<BR>\r\nWith your working knife, draw six circles around the candle making\r\n7 equal parts. This will allow for the<BR>\r\nseven equal days of work Light the incense. Light the candle.\r\nFocus on the flame and visualize the<BR>\r\nperson for whom the spell is intended.<BR>\r\nChant:<BR>\r\nFire, fire burning bright<BR>\r\nAid me in my work tonight<BR>\r\nSend my love to (person\'s name)<BR>\r\nLet him/her know for me they\'re right<BR>\r\nSince this chant is very simple, it will not take away from the\r\nconcentration on the flame and the person,<BR>\r\nbut will aid in building the power necessary to send out your\r\nmessage. Always focusing on the flame and<BR>\r\nvisualizing the intended, repeat the chant until the candle has\r\nburned to the first drawn circle. Pinch or use<BR>\r\na candle snuffer to put out the flame. Never blow out a candle\r\nas this is an insult to the Quarter of Fire.<BR>\r\nDay one of the spell is complete. Put the anointed candle and\r\nincense in a protected place. On days 2 through<BR>\r\n7, anointing of the candle and drawing of the circles is not necessary.\r\nTake your candle to your sacred space,<BR>\r\nface south and perform the same work. By day seven your candle\r\nwill be spent and your complete message sent.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">THE KUNDALINI<BR>\r\nShe is a Goddess of Ecstasy. She will fill you with Her fiery\r\nenergy.<BR>\r\nThe ultimate encounter with Kundalini is when you come to the\r\npoint of feeling that your inside and<BR>\r\noutside selves are one; when you cannot distinguish between the\r\ntwo. You feel your molecules flowing<BR>\r\nwith Her energy and they no longer have a distinct form.<BR>\r\nWhen She retreats, she leaves behind tendrils of flames that flow\r\nthroughout your body frequently setting<BR>\r\noff convulsions of ecstasy. This continuesuntil they snuff out\r\non their own. Depending on your responsiveness<BR>\r\nand the intensity of a particular experience, this post-Kundalini\r\neffect can last for quite some time.<BR>\r\nEach person is different. Each event will also have different\r\neffects.<BR>\r\nThe more in tune you are with your Inner Self, the longer the\r\neffects of Kundalini. This is tantra.<BR>\r\nThis is sexual energy. Tantra events do not necessarily include\r\nsex. However, the inclusion of sex<BR>\r\ncan be very meaningful, especially if the energy is exchanged\r\nbetween you and your partner(s).<BR>\r\nKundalini energy can also be shared with others not in contact\r\nwith you. She permeates the air and<BR>\r\nthose receptive to Her energy may be stirred by it.<BR>\r\nYou do not need to be consciously receptive to Kundalini to feel\r\nHer presence. However, the effects<BR>\r\nare much more enjoyable if you knowingly embrace the energy. In\r\naddition, it is more rewarding to your<BR>\r\npartner(s) if you are aware of Her, since your ability to share\r\nthe experience is heightened.<BR>\r\nThis sharing of the Kundalini is the ultimate union of partners,\r\nfor the two (or more) of you become One.<BR>\r\nThe sharing of Kundalini between same-sex partners is not to be\r\nlessened. Heterosexual and Homosexual<BR>\r\nKundalini experiences are different, but neither is less than\r\nthe other. And the ultimate union can be achieved<BR>\r\nin both cases. Nothing can take away from such an experience between\r\npartners. And nothing can compare.<BR>\r\nI hope all people have the chance to experience the Kundalini.\r\nOnce She comes into your life and you feel Her<BR>\r\nembrace, you will never be the same. Your senses are heightened\r\nwhen She is with you and the world takes on<BR>\r\na sensual quality. Find your Kundalini and enjoy the experience!!!</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">LOVE SPELL<BR>\r\nItems needed: basic altar set-up, red candle, patchouli incense,\r\noil of cinnamon, needle.<BR>\r\nSHIELD, GROUND &amp; CENTER<BR>\r\nCAST CIRCLE<BR>\r\nCHARGE OF THE GODDESS<BR>\r\nLight incense; pass candle three times through smoke and say:<BR>\r\n&quot;Spirit of Air, envelope (name of loved one) with love for\r\nme.&quot;<BR>\r\nTap candle three times with wand and say:<BR>\r\n&quot;Spirit of Fire, fill the heart of (name of loved one) with\r\nlove for me.&quot;<BR>\r\nUsing athame, add three pinches of salt to bowl of water, mix\r\nwith athame, sprinkle a few<BR>\r\ndrops of water over the candle and say:<BR>\r\n&quot;Spirit of Water, wash over (name of loved one)\'s heart with\r\nlove for me.&quot;<BR>\r\nAnoint candle with oil of cinnamon and say:<BR>\r\n&quot;Spirit of Earth, let love for me grow in (name of loved\r\none)\'s heart, mind and soul as your<BR>\r\nplants grow from the ground.&quot;<BR>\r\nUsing athame, scratch name of loved one on candle.<BR>\r\nStick needle through wick of candle and say:<BR>\r\n&quot;Let there be no peace for (name of loved one) until he is\r\none with me.&quot;<BR>\r\nLight candle and say:<BR>\r\n&quot;Let (name of loved one)\'s love burn like this fire.&quot;<BR>\r\n&quot;SO MOTE IT BE!&quot;<BR>\r\nMeditate on the desired outcome of the spell while concentrating\r\non the candle\'s flame.<BR>\r\nRaise power and send forth.

It is supposedly &quot;fail-safe&quot;,\r\nbut remember, you must take<BR>\r\nresponsibility for any results and consequences.<BR>\r\nComponents Needed:<BR>\r\na clear mind and focused goal<BR>\r\nspecial paper, such as hemp, cotton, real parchment, whatever\r\nyou deem special<BR>\r\na ritual writing instrument (the pen is mightier than the Athame)\r\nsuch as quill, fountain pen,<BR>\r\nfavorite ball-point, etc. In whatever color ink desired.<BR>\r\nMoon incense<BR>\r\nCharcoal or a small ritual fire<BR>\r\nTiming: any time, preferably after dark during the waxing moon.<BR>\r\nThe timing is more flexible with this working for many reasons;\r\nthe nature of the work,<BR>\r\nand the full moon energy contained in the moon incense which is\r\nan incense of Increase or drawing.<BR>\r\nReinforce your personal circle/aura (C.O.P. see above) and prepare\r\nfor workings in your<BR>\r\nusual manner. Using the ritual pen and special paper, write words\r\nof power that will call the<BR>\r\nmost perfect partner to you at this time. Do not include specific\r\nnames, and avoid thinking of<BR>\r\na specific person. If you can\'t find quite the right words, use\r\nthe following:<BR>\r\n&quot;If there be a perfect match,<BR>\r\nthis work tonight will surely catch.<BR>\r\nthe perfect one who is meant to be,<BR>\r\nshall find his/her way home to me.<BR>\r\nIn perfect love and perfect trust,<BR>\r\nI send this out, but not from lust,<BR>\r\nThis spell will guide us to unite,<BR>\r\nfree will remains with us tonight.&quot;<BR>\r\nWhen you are finished, read over what you wrote and confirm that\r\neverything you want to<BR>\r\nsay is included. When you are certain it is as you wish, spend\r\nsome time meditating on your<BR>\r\ngoal while you light your ritual fire or the charcoal. When you\r\nget &quot;that feeling&quot; (the one when<BR>\r\nyou know everything is right, your will is focused, you know it\r\nis certain, you know the feeling...)<BR>\r\nprepare to begin the physical aspect of the ritual. When the fire\r\nhas become coals, or the<BR>\r\ncharcoal is glowing happily, read aloud your writing, repeating\r\nit 3X. As you read, or as you<BR>\r\ncome to the end of each repetition, sprinkle a small handful (about\r\na Tablespoon) of the incense<BR>\r\non the fire. You will want to be practiced at this for the best\r\neffect as well as safety, so make up<BR>\r\na full recipe of it and accustom yourself to its nature prior\r\nto the rite.<BR>\r\nFold the paper and keep it near you for three days. Keep it under\r\nyour pillow, mattress, or pinned<BR>\r\nto your night clothes (if you aren\'t sky/star clad) while you\r\nsleep. After three days, light another<BR>\r\nritual fire, repeat the C.O.P., reading and incense procedure\r\nand this time, burn the paper when<BR>\r\nyou are done. OR you can keep the paper in a special spell box\r\nif you use this method.<BR>\r\nMany Witches have special containers to keep finished workings\r\nin. These are usually decorative<BR>\r\nand personalized with engravings or painting on them that echo\r\ntheir contents. For example, a heart<BR>\r\nshaped heartwood box with runes and magical symbols of love on\r\nit for this spell.

It is a simple\r\nrough figure from 2 pieces of cloth.<BR>\r\nWhile cutting the cloth, concentrate on who it will represent.<BR>\r\nIt may then be worked on further with embroidering it with facial\r\nfeatures, special<BR>\r\ncharacteristics such as a beard, moustache, long hair, etc. Even\r\nastrological signs<BR>\r\nand the person\'s name can be embroidered onto the doll to help\r\nsymbolize who it represents.<BR>\r\nSew the figure leaving the top open.<BR>\r\nThe figure should then be stuffed with the appropriate herbs again\r\nconcentrating on the person.<BR>\r\nYou must use any 3 or more of these love herbs: Verbena, Vervain,\r\nRosemary, Rose petals,<BR>\r\nCinnamon, Patchouli, Yarrow, Valerian, Catnip, Lavender, Rosebuds,\r\nStrawberry leaves,<BR>\r\nJasmine or Ginger may be used.<BR>\r\n(These herbs are ruled by Venus) Along with the love herbs; .add\r\nto your lover\'s poppet,<BR>\r\nsome of your moon-blood (a powerful option), some of your pubic\r\nhair and some of your<BR>\r\nunderarm hair (don\'t shave your armpits for a few days if this\r\nspell is to work well!)<BR>\r\nThe top may then be sewn closed.<BR>\r\nThe two figures must be prepared this way.

Gypsies use the pendulum quite a lot. One\r\nof the uses to which they put it is in<BR>\r\ndetermining whether or not a particular lover is the right one\r\nfor you.<BR>\r\nThe pendulum itself should be a ring suspended on a length of\r\nred silk thread or ribbon.<BR>\r\nMany girls use their mother\'s wedding band for the ring. The only\r\nother thing you need is a<BR>\r\nconnection with the one you are wondering about. This can be an\r\narticle of his or her clothing,<BR>\r\na handkerchief, a watch, ring, or other piece of jewelry, a photograph,\r\nor anything similar that has<BR>\r\na direct link with the person.<BR>\r\nSimply sit with the object, photograph, or whatever in front of\r\nyou and hold the pendulum over it.<BR>\r\nIt doesn\'t matter whether or not your elbow rests on the table,\r\nbut hold the thread so that the ring<BR>\r\nis suspended about an inch or so above the object. Allow seven\r\ninches of the thread between<BR>\r\nyour fingers and the ring.<BR>\r\nConcentrate your thoughts on the person you are wondering about.\r\nIs he/she the right one for you?<BR>\r\nThink of all their good qualities, and their bad. Then say:<BR>\r\nAv, ml Romani mal,<BR>\r\nPawdel dur chumbas.<BR>\r\nAv kitane mansa?<BR>\r\nThis little verse in Romanes (the Gypsy language) can be roughly\r\ntranslated as<BR>\r\n&quot;Come my Gypsy friend, over the hills so far away. Will you\r\ncome along with me?&quot;<BR>\r\nRepeat it, saying it three times in all.<BR>\r\nAs you say the verse the pendulum will start to swing. If it swings\r\nbackwards and<BR>\r\nforwards, towards you and away from you, then it means &quot;yes,&quot;\r\nthat person is the<BR>\r\nright one for you. But if it swings from side to side, across\r\nyou, then it means &quot;no,&quot;<BR>\r\nthey are not right for you. With some people the pendulum may\r\nswing in a circle, rather<BR>\r\nthan backwards and forwards. If it does, then clockwise means\r\n&quot;Yes&quot; and<BR>\r\ncounterclockwise means &quot;no&quot;.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">KEY TO THE HEART<BR>\r\nIt is considered very lucky to find a key. Any sort of key is\r\nlucky, but an antique one is especially so.<BR>\r\nAs with the finding of something red, there are words to say at\r\nthe time of finding it:<BR>\r\nThe key to your heart lies on the ground.<BR>\r\nThe key to your heart has now been found.<BR>\r\nI lock up your love with the heart of my own,<BR>\r\nI\'ll guard it forever with the love I have shown.<BR>\r\nAs you say these words, think of the one you love and of the two\r\nof you being together forever.<BR>\r\nSleep with the key under your pillow for nine nights, carrying\r\nit with you during the day.<BR>\r\nIt may then be put in a place of safety.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">TO DRAW A LOVER TO YOU<BR>\r\nHere again, it\'s not a case of drawing a specific person to you.\r\nRather, this Magick is to draw<BR>\r\n&quot;someone&quot; to you. No names, though you can certainly\r\nspecify the type of person, e.g., &quot;a dark,<BR>\r\nsix-footer, with a sense of humor and an interest in hang-gliding,&quot;\r\nor whatever.<BR>\r\nThe two favorite semiprecious &quot;stones&quot; of the Gypsies\r\nare jet and amber. Of course neither one is<BR>\r\ntruly a stone. Jet is an organic product: bituminous coal that\r\ncan be polished. Amber is the fossilized,<BR>\r\nhardened resin of the pine tree Pinus succinifera, formed during\r\nthe Bocene period (about 50 million<BR>\r\nyears ago). For this spell you need a piece of amber, and it should\r\n(for best results) be a piece with<BR>\r\nan insect inclusion. If not available, then any piece if amber\r\ncan be used.<BR>\r\nThis should be done on a Friday, first thing in the morning when\r\nyou rise and before you do<BR>\r\nanything else. Take a piece of amber and hold it in your (closed)\r\nleft hand. Hold the hand over<BR>\r\nyour heart, close your eyes, and concentrate your thoughts on\r\nthe type of person you want to<BR>\r\nattract to you. See him or her in as much detail as you can: height,\r\nweight, eye and hair coloring.<BR>\r\nThink of the interests, sports, activities, you would like them\r\nto have. Then see the two of you<BR>\r\ntogether, walking hand in hand.<BR>\r\nNow kiss the amber and place it in a piece of pink or red silk\r\nand wrap it up securely. Carry that<BR>\r\nwith you at all times for the next seven days, sleeping with it\r\nunder your pillow. Every morning<BR>\r\nrepeat the holding and visualizing, though hold it still wrapped\r\nin the silk; don\'t unwrap it.<BR>\r\nBy the seventh day you will have met something just like the person\r\nyou have been wishing for.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">TO BRING OUT THE LOVE OF ANOTHER<BR>\r\nThis is an interesting spell. It does not interfere with another\'s\r\nfree will.<BR>\r\nAll it does is give them the courage to state what is on their<BR>\r\nmind. It is done when you feel very strongly that the person is\r\nin love with you but that they<BR>\r\nhesitate to say so. If it turns out that they are not in love\r\nwith you after all, then it simply won\'t<BR>\r\nwork, so that\'s why it doesn\'t exert undue pressure.<BR>\r\nThis should be done at the same hour on seven consecutive Fridays,\r\nending on the one<BR>\r\nclosest to the Full Moon (before the moon reaches full, not just\r\nafter).<BR>\r\nTake a pink candle and mark six rings around it, at equal distances\r\napart. This will give you<BR>\r\nseven sections of a candle.<BR>\r\nLight the candle and call out the name of the one you think loves\r\nyou. Then say:<BR>\r\nGana, be with me in all that I do.<BR>\r\nGana, please bring me a love who is true.<BR>\r\nGive him (her) the strength to put into words<BR>\r\nHis (her) fee, lings, and sing like the song of the birds.<BR>\r\nThink about the person for a few moments - think of them coming\r\nto you and declaring their<BR>\r\nlove then repeat the chant. Keep doing this until the candle has\r\nburned dawn to the first line.<BR>\r\nThen extinguish the candle (by pinching it out, never by blowing)\r\nand put it away till next week.<BR>\r\nOn the final week, keep it up until the candle burns itself out.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">LOVE STRENGTHENING SPELL<BR>\r\nTOOLS:    small flower pot<BR>\r\nearth=fresh, not bought (can be in small pot)<BR>\r\nseeds that will grow inside (one seed for each year or month together)<BR>\r\nsmall cup of water     2 candles , white, red<BR>\r\nhair, cloth, nail clipping, something personal from both parties\r\nashtray<BR>\r\nTake bath clear mind of everything listen to your own heart beat\r\ntill you go blank and feel clean<BR>\r\nnot necessary but is helpful if it is after the New Moon<BR>\r\nAfter bath, go to quite place where tools are laid before you,\r\nsit down see yourself in a ball like<BR>\r\ncircle (sphere) above and below you or cast a circle if you know\r\nhow.<BR>\r\nlight white candle<BR>\r\ncall on the Gods or Goddesses or your choice to guard, watch,\r\naid you in your workings<BR>\r\nlight red candle, burn personal items together in ashtray<BR>\r\nplace ash in earth, moisten earth with half the cup of water<BR>\r\nas you plant seeds say charm:<BR>\r\nWe are grown and gathered and bound<BR>\r\nWe are planted beneath the land<BR>\r\nWater of life    Blood of earth<BR>\r\nSeeds yet sleep<BR>\r\nI draw thee forth<BR>\r\nI honor thee<BR>\r\nNow favor me<BR>\r\nAs I will it<BR>\r\nSo mote it be!<BR>\r\n9. add rest of water bid gods farewell, or open circle, place\r\npot in sunny window or under lamp water once a week as it grows\r\nso your love.<BR>\r\nThis is not a binding spell it is only to strengthen and grow\r\nwhat is already there.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">TO ENFLAME DESIRE<BR>\r\nIngredients:    3 hairs from the head of the person<BR>\r\na candle in the shape of phallus (for a man) or a womb (for a\r\nwoman), the candle can be red for sex<BR>\r\nand passion, or green for love and affection olive oil plain piece\r\nof paper<BR>\r\nProcedure: If you make your own candle, wait until Friday to prepare\r\nthe wax.

On a Friday<BR>\r\nnight with a waxing moon, take the candle into your hands and\r\nthink hard on the relationship you<BR>\r\ndesire to have with your loved one. See yourself with this person\r\nin the present, doing all you desire to do.<BR>\r\nNow anoint the candle with olive oil, using sensuous, caressing\r\nmotion, as you were attending your<BR>\r\nlover. Never stop imagining how it is when you are together. Finally,\r\nlight the candle and pray that<BR>\r\nyour lover will come to you. Write your lover\'s name three times\r\non a plain piece of paper, and burn<BR>\r\nit in the flaming wick.

To speed the melting process, grate or chop the paraffin into\r\nsmall pieces before melting.<BR>\r\nFill the large pot about 1/3 full of water. Place on high heat\r\nuntil boiling.<BR>\r\nPlace the paraffin in the coffee can, and set the can into the\r\npot. Turn the heat down to medium.<BR>\r\nWatch the paraffin as it\'s melting. Paraffin easily bursts into\r\nflames over high heat (this is exactly<BR>\r\nwhy it\'s used to make candles). If flames appear, place a lid\r\nover the can or drench the area with<BR>\r\nbaking soda to snuff out the fire. If you keep the heat low you\r\nshould have no problems.<BR>\r\n2. While the paraffin is melting, place the two spices into the\r\nbowl. Mix them together, empowering<BR>\r\nthem as you visualize money manifesting in your life. Infuse the\r\nherbs with your goal.<BR>\r\n3. Check the paraffin. For best results, you should have at least\r\n6 inches of melted paraffin.<BR>\r\nIf there\'s less, add more paraffin. (If the paraffin has melted,\r\nbut has begun to harden, the heat<BR>\r\nis too low. Turn it up a bit.) Add a few chunks of green candle\r\ndye to the paraffin and mix with<BR>\r\nthe wooden spoon. Alternately, remove the paper wrappings from\r\na green crayon, break it into<BR>\r\npieces, and add this to the paraffin. The dye will melt. Stir\r\nuntil the paraffin is evenly colored.<BR>\r\nThe finished, dried candles will be a shade or two lighter than\r\nthe color of the melted paraffin.<BR>\r\nMore dye may be necessary to create the desired dark green shade.<BR>\r\n4. Once the paraffin has been tinted, sprinkle the spices onto\r\nthe paraffin with your projective hand.<BR>\r\nDust off your fingers over the pot and stir the herbs into the\r\nparaffin with the wooden spoon.<BR>\r\nStir clockwise and visualize. Add eight to sixteen drops patchouli\r\nessential oil to the paraffin and<BR>\r\nagain stir with the wooden spoon. Smell the paraffin. It should\r\nbe heavily scented.<BR>\r\nIf not, add more patchouli oil.<BR>\r\n5. Begin dipping. Hold a length of cotton wicking between your\r\nthumb and forefinger.<BR>\r\nDunk it into the paraffin. It will probably just float on the\r\nsurface the first few times you<BR>\r\ndo this, for the wick lacks enough weight to plunge it to the\r\nbottom of the can.<BR>\r\nAfter dipping, remove it and hold it in the air for a moment or\r\ntwo until the paraffin has set,<BR>\r\nthen dip again. Dip again, lifting the wicking completely from\r\nthe melted paraffin, allow<BR>\r\nthe paraffin to set, and re-dip. Repeat as needed.<BR>\r\nThe longer you wait between drippings, allowing the paraffin to\r\nharden, the faster the candle<BR>\r\nwill build up. If you simply dunk and dunk and dunk, the hot paraffin\r\nwill melt each proceeding<BR>\r\ncoat and you\'ll end up with a soggy piece of wick. With proper\r\ndipping, the candle will soon form.<BR>\r\nIts bottom will grow into an inverted cone-shape from the paraffin\r\nthat drips down the taper\'s<BR>\r\nsides as it cools. This is natural; don\'t worry about it.<BR>\r\n6. When the candle has achieved the proper width, hang it dry\r\nin a spot where it won\'t be<BR>\r\ntouched for several minutes. Test the candle after 20 or so minutes.\r\nThe paraffin should have<BR>\r\nset but the taper should still be warm. Check it periodically\r\nto be sure that it hasn\'t completely<BR>\r\nhardened before the next step.<BR>\r\n7. Turn off the heat under the paraffin. Place the wax paper on\r\na counter or table.<BR>\r\nLay the candle on the paper and gently, with an easy rocking motion\r\nroll the candle back<BR>\r\nand fourth on the wax paper. This straightens the taper and reduces\r\nirregularities on its surface.<BR>\r\n8. When the candle is fairly straight, cut off the inverted cone\r\nat the bottom of the candle with a<BR>\r\nsharp knife. Dip the taper two more times into the melted paraffin\r\nand hang to dry until hard.<BR>\r\nYou\'ve just made a money candle. (To save time and produce more\r\ntapers, make two, three,<BR>\r\nor four at a time. Hang each to dry as you dip the next.)<BR>\r\n9.

Melt this\r\nslowly in a double<BR>\r\nboiler, or in a pan over boiling water, and mix the shavings with\r\na bit of water so they<BR>\r\ndon\'t stick together in the pan. When you have a nice, smooth\r\nconsistency to work<BR>\r\nwith, you can add empowered ingredients. Good ingredients to add\r\nwould be:<BR>\r\n-money herbs and oils, such as patchouli, mint, basil, cinquefoil,\r\nginger, sage,<BR>\r\nTonka, nutmeg, oak moss and lemon balm.<BR>\r\n-empowered gold glitter<BR>\r\n-Green vegetable coloring (or whatever color you correspond money\r\nand prosperity with)<BR>\r\nOnce you have added your ingredients, let the mixture cool slightly\r\nuntil you can start<BR>\r\nforming it in your hands. You can now roll it into balls, wrap\r\nthem up in some<BR>\r\ncheesecloth or muslin, and let them harden.<BR>\r\nAn easier way to make a quick money soap is to purchase some melt\r\n&amp; pour glycerin from<BR>\r\na craft store - I think they even have it at Wal-Mart. It\'s sold\r\nin blocks. Melt the blocks in<BR>\r\nglassware over the stove or on the microwave until it is liquid.<BR>\r\nAdd your empowered ingredients quickly, as melt &amp; pour sets\r\nfast.<BR>\r\nNext, pour the mixture into a mold (these can be purchased also,\r\nor you can make<BR>\r\nmolds from just about anything from margarine tubs to juice cans\r\nto empty toilet paper<BR>\r\nrolls with foil on one end) and let the soap set.<BR>\r\nMelt and pour soap is easier to work with, because you can add\r\nyour ingredients much<BR>\r\neasier, and you don\'t end up with so much soap afterwards. You\r\ncan also make bars<BR>\r\nthat are individual to your needs. For example, try pouring half\r\nthe mixture into the mold,<BR>\r\nadd a toy coin or a plastic dollar sign which you have empowered,\r\nthen pour the rest into the mold.<BR>\r\nWhen hardened, you will have a soap with an empowered item in\r\nthe middle of it.<BR>\r\nYou could even put a charged stone in the middle of the soap.<BR>\r\nCreating the soap with your individuality only makes it more powerful.<BR>\r\nThe best part? The above directions can be used for any magickal\r\ngoal, not just money!<BR>\r\nOne more thing, when using your soap, concentrate clearly on your\r\nintentions and visualize!<BR>\r\nFor money, visualize the soap attracting the money to you.<BR>\r\nFor illness, visualize the soap cleaning the illness out of you.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">SILVER SUCCESS SPELL<BR>\r\nThis spell should be cast on a Wednesday - the day for growth.\r\nBurn incense<BR>\r\nthroughout this ritual.<BR>\r\nSit cross legged on the floor.

They are best taken in a cup\r\nof tea, three to five times a day.<BR>\r\nDuring the waxing phase I also like to increase water intake to\r\navoid water retention.<BR>\r\nThe more water we ingest, the less water our bodies attempt to\r\nretain.<BR>\r\nThis is also a good time to apply medicinal salves and to take\r\ntherapeutic baths.<BR>\r\nMost importantly, I work during the waxing Moon to ensure that\r\nthe body has all the<BR>\r\nnutritional support it needs. This is the body\'s building time,\r\nand it needs a good supply<BR>\r\nof minerals, vitamins, carbohydrates, lipids, and amino acids\r\nto be healthy.<BR>\r\nI would also not attempt to fast or to lose weight during the\r\nwaxing Moon.<BR>\r\nUse energy healing techniques to strengthen and reconnect with\r\nthe earth.<BR>\r\nBe careful to ground and center when healing so that you never\r\nuse up your own life force energy.<BR>\r\nThe universe is full of energy to use, and by tapping into it\r\nyou will be able to help many more<BR>\r\npeople than you could by using just your energy alone.<BR>\r\nFULL MOON<BR>\r\nThe Full Moon lasts about three days. It is a very intense phase.\r\nMany women still ovulate with the<BR>\r\nFull Moon. This is the time to apply the most powerful herbs.\r\nUse cayenne capsules to<BR>\r\ntreat infections of any kind. Goldenseal is a well-known herbal\r\nantibiotic. Echinacea and lomatium<BR>\r\nare anti-viral. Dong quai is an excellent herb for female hormonal\r\nfluctuations.<BR>\r\nEnergy healing work during the Full Moon is very powerful. On\r\nthe energetic level, it acts like a<BR>\r\nmagnifying mirror. The strong lunar energy pulls everything out\r\nof hiding and reflects it back at us.<BR>\r\nThis is often the time during an acute illness when people feel\r\ntheir worst. The Full Moon intensifies<BR>\r\nwhatever else is going on. Often people aren\'t even aware that\r\nthey\'re sick until the Full Moon hits.<BR>\r\nThis is also an excellent time for psychological therapy. Emotions\r\nseem closer to the surface than<BR>\r\nusual and social inhibitions melt away. Agendas that have been\r\nsimmering under the surface tend<BR>\r\nto come out under the light of the Full Moon. This is a time to\r\nstrengthen relationships and reaffirm<BR>\r\nbonds. Never underestimate the healing power of simply holding\r\nsomeone\'s hand and listening.<BR>\r\nThis is not the time for isolation or introspection . The Full\r\nMoon draws all of life toward it.<BR>\r\nEven the solid ground rises several inches when the Full Moon\r\npasses overhead!<BR>\r\nWANING MOON<BR>\r\nThe waning Moon is the best time to employ therapeutic fasts.\r\nAvoid drastic fasting.<BR>\r\nThere is usually no need to starve the body to heal it. However,\r\nit may be helpful to limit<BR>\r\nyour intake to juices and soups for a few days during the waning\r\nMoon, particularly when<BR>\r\nstruggling with the flu. Use purifying herbs in moderation at\r\nthis time. Sage,<BR>\r\nusnea, ginger, lemon, thyme, lavender, and peppermint are all\r\ncleansing and clearing herbs.<BR>\r\nThe waning Moon is also a good time to do sweats and diaphoretic\r\n(sweat producing) baths.<BR>\r\nIn addition, if you are trying to kick a habit, do it during the\r\nwaning phase.<BR>\r\nUse energy healing techniques to sever unhealthy bonds and strengthen\r\nboundaries.<BR>\r\nNEW MOON<BR>\r\nThe New Moon is as powerful in its own way as the Full Moon. It\r\nis a time for taking stock.<BR>\r\nIt is a phase of hibernation, retreat, and contemplation. Avoid\r\ncrowds and gatherings and<BR>\r\nseek a little time for yourself. Rest is crucial during the New\r\nMoon.<BR>\r\nSimple foods and quiet times are powerful healers. Many women\r\nmenstruate with the New Moon.<BR>\r\nIt is natural to want to curl up in bed with a good book and nice\r\ncup of chamomile tea.<BR>\r\nStronger nervines (relaxing herbs) are skullcap, hops, catnip,\r\noatstraw, and valerian.<BR>\r\nAfter the New Moon ends and that first crescent appears, then\r\nthe healing lunar cycle<BR>\r\nbegins all over again.

Because of this,\r\nthe light of the Moon was<BR>\r\nconsidered magical, and a source of energy. Wiccans often practice\r\nmagic at a Full Moon to<BR>\r\ntap into this energy thought to exist at this time.<BR>\r\nPlutarch once said &quot;Egyptian priests called the Moon the\r\n&quot;Mother of the Universe,&quot; because<BR>\r\nthe moon, &quot;having the light which makes moist and pregnant,\r\nis promotive of the generation<BR>\r\nof living beings..&quot; The Gnostic sect of Naassians believed\r\nin a primordial being known as<BR>\r\n&quot;the heavenly horn of the moon.&quot; The Moon was the Great\r\nMother.<BR>\r\nMenos meant &quot;Moon&quot; and &quot;power&quot; to the Greeks.\r\nTo the Romans, the morality of the Moon<BR>\r\nGoddess was above that of the Sun God.<BR>\r\nIn many cultures the Moon Goddess and the Creatress were the same.\r\nPolynesians called the<BR>\r\nCreatress Hina, &quot;Moon.&quot; She was the first woman, and\r\nevery woman is a wahine, made in the<BR>\r\nimage of Hina. Scandinavians sometimes called the Creatress Mardoll,\r\n&quot;Moon Shining Over the Sea.&quot;<BR>\r\nAshanti people had a generic term used for all their deities,\r\nBoshun, meaning Moon.<BR>\r\nSioux Native Americans call the moon The Old Woman Who Never Dies.\r\nIroquois call her<BR>\r\n&quot;Eternal One.&quot; Rulers in the Eritrean zone of South\r\nAfrica held the Goddesses name &quot;Moon.&quot;<BR>\r\nThe Gaelic name of the Moon, gealach, came form Gala or Galata,\r\nthe original Moon-Mother of<BR>\r\nGaelic and Gaulish tribes. Britain used to be called Albion, the\r\nmilk-white Moon-Goddess. The<BR>\r\nMoon was called Metra, which means Mother , &quot;whose love penetrated\r\neverywhere.&quot;<BR>\r\nIn the Basque language, the words for deity and moon are the same.<BR>\r\nThe root word for both &quot;moon&quot; and &quot;mind&quot; was\r\nthe Indo-European manas, mana, or men,<BR>\r\nrepresenting the Great Mother\'s &quot;wise blood&quot; in women,\r\ngoverned by the Moon. The derivative<BR>\r\nmania used to mean ecstatic revelation, like lunacy used to mean\r\npossession by spirit of Luna,<BR>\r\nthe Moon. To be Moon-Touched or Moon-Struck meant to be chosen\r\nby the Goddess.<BR>\r\nWhen patriarchal thinkers belittled the Goddess, these words came\r\nto mean craziness.<BR>\r\nOrphic and Pythagorean sect viewed the Moon as the home of the\r\ndead, a female gate known<BR>\r\nas Yoni. Souls passed through on the way to the paradise fields\r\nof the stars. Greeks often located<BR>\r\nthe Elysian Fields, home of the blessed dead, in the moon. The\r\nshoes of Toman senators were<BR>\r\ndecorated with ivory crescents to show that after death they would\r\ninhabit the Moon. Roman<BR>\r\nreligion taught that &quot;the souls of the just are purified\r\nin the Moon.&quot; Wearing the crescent was<BR>\r\n&quot;visual worship&quot; of the Goddess. That was why the prophet\r\nIsaiah denounced the women of<BR>\r\nZion for wearing lunar amulets.<BR>\r\nBecause the moon was the holder of souls between reincarnations,\r\nit sheltered both the dead<BR>\r\nand unborn, who were one in the same. If a man dreams of his own\r\nimage in the Moon, he would<BR>\r\nbecome the father of a son. If a woman dreamed of her own image\r\nin the Moon, she would have<BR>\r\na daughter.<BR>\r\nThe Moon Goddess created time, with all its cycles of creation,\r\ngrowth, decline, and destruction.<BR>\r\nThis is why ancient calendars were based on phases of the moon\r\nand menstrual cycles.<BR>\r\nThe Moon still determines agricultural work in some parts of India.\r\nIndonesian moon priestesses<BR>\r\nwere responsible for finding the right phase of the moon for every\r\nundertaking.<BR>\r\nThe Moon was to have been the receptacle of menstrual blood by\r\nwhich each mother formed<BR>\r\nthe life of her child. This sacer, taboo moon-fluid kept even\r\nthe Gods alive. The moon was &quot;the<BR>\r\ncup of the fluid of life immortal, quickening the vegetable realm\r\nand whatsoever grows in the<BR>\r\nsub-lunar sphere, quickening also the immortals on high.&quot;<BR>\r\nThe Moon was supposed to rule life and death as well as the tides.\r\nPeople living on the shores<BR>\r\nwere convinced that a baby could only be born on an incoming tide\r\nand a person could not die<BR>\r\nuntil the tide went out. It was often said birth at a full tide\r\nor a full moon means a lucky life.<BR>\r\nGirls in Scotland refused to wed on anything but a Full Moon.<BR>\r\nWitches invoked their Goddess by &quot;drawing down the Moon.&quot;\r\nIt is said to be a rite dating back<BR>\r\nto moon worship in Thessaly, centuries before the Christian era.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Esbats<BR>\r\nLunar holidays are also known as Esbats, but any Wiccan ritual\r\nheld at any time other than<BR>\r\na Sabbat is an Esbat.

Learn\r\nthe characteristics of each<BR>\r\nphase and you\'ll be guided into taking appropriate action, whether\r\nin personal or business relationships.<BR>\r\nThe power and consciousness behind each lunar phase is awesome.\r\nLet the Moon support you. It will<BR>\r\nshow you how to stay emotionally and physically balanced and also\r\nput money in your pocket.<BR>\r\nThe Moon governs the general public, sales, and business in general.<BR>\r\nThe overall cycle of the phases governs the acceleration or deceleration\r\nof growth and<BR>\r\nmomentum. Ideally, start projects and build them when the Moon\r\nis increasing in light --<BR>\r\n&quot;waxing&quot; -- from New Moon to Full Moon. From the Full\r\nMoon to the oncoming New Moon,<BR>\r\nthe Moon is decreasing in light -- &quot;waning&quot; -- and this\r\nis when you want to bring whatever<BR>\r\nactivities you can to a completion. Keep this ebb and flow of\r\nenergy in mind and you\'ll have<BR>\r\nan invaluable tool to help you flow with the tide of events, rather\r\nthan against them.<BR>\r\nEach phase represents a segment of time within the monthly lunation\r\ncycle as a whole.

In other words<BR>\r\n&quot;Space is Curved.&quot; Whatever you send out will come back\r\nto you at the appropriate time, and<BR>\r\nit\'s a good idea to know where you stand in the overall cycle.\r\nUnderstanding the lunar rhythms<BR>\r\nwill also save on panic and worry, as you realize that everything\r\nin life unfolds in exactly the right moment.<BR>\r\nNew Moon - &quot;Beginnings.&quot; Subjective-Inner awareness\r\nstarts to open; new seed-ideas<BR>\r\nbegins to unfold in the inner consciousness.

Gathering knowledge prepares you to take future\r\naction.<BR>\r\nFirst Quarter - &quot;Action.&quot; Take action in the outer world.\r\nPick up hammer and nails and<BR>\r\nbuild new structures. There\'s an urgency about facing the challenge\r\nof the moment. Move<BR>\r\nforward, or be buried in the past. Stand up or sit down, but don\'t\r\nwobble.<BR>\r\nGibbous - &quot;Analysis.&quot; Make adjustments to clarify your\r\nsense of direction.

There is a sort of dead space when this is happening.\r\nThe rule here is to avoid<BR>\r\ndoing any important magick work while the moon is avoid of course.\r\nDon\'t do any major<BR>\r\nmagick work. Don\'t complete any magick work.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">MOON WOBBLES<BR>\r\nA Moon Wobble is generally an unsettling time of sudden ups and\r\ndowns, increased accidents<BR>\r\nand violence, unusual or extreme weather, greater incidence of\r\nearth activity, e.g. earthquakes,<BR>\r\nvolcanic eruptions, and intense, often volatile emotional behavior.\r\nPeople feel more restless and<BR>\r\nare more likely to over-react to problems. Anything begun during\r\na Moon Wobble is usually<BR>\r\nshort-lived because of the unstable energy--on average lasting\r\n3 months to one year.<BR>\r\nMoon Wobbles have benefits, too. They can be very stimulating\r\ntimes, bringing new contacts,<BR>\r\ninnovative ideas, heightened creativity, and unexpected opportunities.\r\nUse them to gather<BR>\r\ninformation and consider different options, but wait until they\r\nare over to make final agreements<BR>\r\nand actually begin new ventures. This powerful cycle was first\r\nrecognized, then researched<BR>\r\nand named by noted American mathematician and astrologer Carl\r\nPayne Tobey. He found that<BR>\r\nthese cycles of intensified energies occur when the transiting\r\nSun makes contact with the<BR>\r\nLunar Nodes (the Lunar Nodes are where the orbit of the Moon intersects\r\nthe orbit of the Earth<BR>\r\naround the Sun). There are usually 3.5 to 4 Moon Wobbles a year;\r\nhowever, occasionally there<BR>\r\nare 5, as in 1996. The focus for Moon Wobble phenomena varies\r\naccording to the sign the<BR>\r\nMoon Wobble is occurring in; however, there are some general &quot;rules\r\nof thumb&quot; that apply to<BR>\r\nall Moon Wobbles. Try to AVOID:<BR>\r\nBuying a home or moving<BR>\r\nStarting a new job or project<BR>\r\nHaving important medical work done<BR>\r\nHaving major car or home repairs done<BR>\r\nTaking long-distance trips: If you do travel, BE FLEXIBLE!<BR>\r\nHaving arguments or confrontations with the closest people in\r\nyour life. They can easily escalate<BR>\r\nout of proportion and be very difficult to resolve.<BR>\r\nREMEMBER to:<BR>\r\nRemind yourself it is a Moon Wobble when difficulties arise.<BR>\r\nTry to ACT not REACT in dealing with problems.<BR>\r\nBe flexible and roll with the punches.<BR>\r\nDrive with extra care.<BR>\r\nExpect the unexpected!</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">MOON PHASE MAGICK<BR>\r\nNew Moon workings can be done from the day of the new moon to\r\nthree-and-a-half days after.<BR>\r\nThe new moon is for starting new ventures, new beginnings.

Have a Chalice of wine on the altar\r\nto drink from after the blessing.<BR>\r\nRemember, the more energy and work that you put into your blessing\r\nceremony , the<BR>\r\nmore magical energy it will take on. You may even use an energy\r\nbell or Tibetan bell<BR>\r\nto signify that you are beginning to call those spiritual guides\r\nto assist you with your<BR>\r\nblessing of the rings. Once you have found that place, take a\r\nsmudge wand of Sage,<BR>\r\nlight it and begin to clear the air around the altar. Constantly,\r\nkeep Love and Light in<BR>\r\nyour consciousness. Now, move to the four elements and ask for\r\ntheir guiding presence<BR>\r\nand for their blessing for your rings.<BR>\r\nUse a compass if needed to find the proper directions on the Earth.<BR>\r\nNorth =Earth South = Fire East = Air West = Water Around = Spirit<BR>\r\nAsk for their blessings and honor their assistance.<BR>\r\nNext, begin to set up the altar, placing each of the two rings\r\nyou wish to bless on the altar<BR>\r\ngently and reverence. You may wish to use two 7 day candles (buy\r\ncheaply) to represent<BR>\r\nthe eternal presence of the God and Goddess in your life. Black\r\nfor God, White for Goddess.<BR>\r\nRed Candle for fire, incense for Air, small bowl of water for\r\nwest, and salt for the Earth and North.<BR>\r\nOnce your altar is set up the way you want it, spend a few moments\r\nin quiet meditation<BR>\r\nthinking about what this Ring Blessing Ceremony means to you.\r\nNow, allow the altar to<BR>\r\nfill you with its magic and energy. Feel the magic around you.\r\nbreathe in the Love and Light<BR>\r\nfrom the Lord and Lady. Visual yourself and your love for each\r\nother revitalized because<BR>\r\nof it\'s presence. See yourself becoming more healthy, whole, and\r\nwise.<BR>\r\nNow, say aloud the Blessings you have written for each other.<BR>\r\nSprinkle the rings with Salt for North; (Earth)<BR>\r\nPass rings over or through the red candle flame;<BR>\r\nSouth (Fire) Sprinkle rings with water,<BR>\r\nWest (Water) Pass rings through Incense smoke,<BR>\r\nEast; (Air) Say something like:<BR>\r\n&quot;We pledge these rings consecrated to the Lord and Lady<BR>\r\nto each other as an outward symbol of our love for each other\r\n.&quot;<BR>\r\nDrink some wine from the Chalice holding it each to the others\r\nlips.

Some folks\r\nstrain it afterward.<BR>\r\nTo enhance the actual weird scent of John the Conqueror root,\r\nfrom which no essential<BR>\r\noil can be extracted, I compound a &quot;woodsy blend&quot; scent,\r\nsuch as Cedarwood and Vetivert,<BR>\r\nwhich smells quite a lot like the John the Conqueror root itself.<BR>\r\nThis fragrance is NOT part of the &quot;Magick&quot; in the oil,\r\nbut it does serve as a re-enforcer of<BR>\r\nwhat the real root smells like.<BR>\r\nLet the root fragments and/or powder sit in the oil blend at least\r\na week before use --<BR>\r\na month is better. The root is traditionally left in the bottle\r\nas it is used. If you are making up<BR>\r\nsmall bottles (e.g. a dram vial or 1/2 oz. bottle), you should\r\nput two or three pieces of root in<BR>\r\neach bottle. If you work out of a large stock bottle (e.g. 4 oz.\r\nor 16 oz.) be sure to refresh the<BR>\r\nroot with new pieces each time you top up the bottle.<BR>\r\nBEWARE commercial John the Conqueror and High Conquering oils!\r\nThey rarely have the<BR>\r\nroot in them. all you have to do is look in the bottle: If there\r\nis no root in it, and it was made in<BR>\r\na factory, it\'s very likely a fake.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">COME TO ME OIL<BR>\r\nRecipes vary from person to person.

Doing this\r\nincreases the magical intent<BR>\r\nof the mixture and so helps give it a boost).<BR>\r\nAfter 33 min, ensure that the beeswax is quite liquid and use\r\na mesh strainer you don\'t intend<BR>\r\nto use again to strain out the herbs from the mixture of beeswax\r\nand jojoba oil and place the<BR>\r\nmix back into the glass double boiler. Don\'t worry if you still\r\nhave some herb in it however the<BR>\r\nherb will decay and so this shortens the life of your mix. By\r\nthis time, if you have kept your<BR>\r\nmixture at a constant low temperature, you should notice that\r\nit has a slightly different consistency<BR>\r\nfrom cooling.

Water<BR>\r\n2. Water and steam<BR>\r\n3. Direct steam<BR>\r\nDistillation is basically, producing steam. The steam is passed\r\nthrough the herbal material.<BR>\r\nThe steam carries the Essential oil from the plant in suspension\r\nwhich means the droplets of<BR>\r\nessential oils are not dissolved in the steam but remain separate\r\nas droplets of oil.<BR>\r\nWhen the steam is cooled it reverts to the liquid state which\r\nis water and in most cases the<BR>\r\noil floats on the surface of the water. The oil is then separated\r\nfrom the water by dripping or pouring.<BR>\r\n1. Water distillation is used when the plant material has been\r\ndried and will not be damaged by boiling.<BR>\r\nIt is also used for powdered materials such as powdered almond,\r\nand flowers, such as orange<BR>\r\nand rose, that need to float freely as they tend to lump together\r\nwhen just steam is passed<BR>\r\nthrough them. The material comes into direct contact with the\r\nboiling water and much care<BR>\r\nneeds to be taken that the water does not boil away and cause\r\nthe plant material to burn.<BR>\r\nAnother example of an oil prepared by this method is turpentine\r\ngum. Turpentine gum is<BR>\r\ncollected from a species of Pine (Pinus palustris) and the gum,\r\nwood chips and pine needles<BR>\r\nare placed in the distilling chamber with rain water. This mixture\r\nis heated until the plant<BR>\r\nand oil are condensed in the condensing chamber. Turpentine oil\r\nis not affected by very excessive heat.<BR>\r\n2. The second method of distillation is water and steam.<BR>\r\nThis is used for either fresh or dried plant material that would\r\nbe damaged by boiling.<BR>\r\nThe plant material is supported on a perforated grid.<BR>\r\nThe water level is below the grid and low pressure, wet steam\r\npasses through the plant material.<BR>\r\nThe most important aspect of this method is that the steam is\r\nnever really hot and always at low<BR>\r\npressure. Cinnamon and clove oils are prepared by this method.<BR>\r\n3. Direct steam distillation is similar to the second method but\r\nthe steam is hotter and passed<BR>\r\nthrough the plant material at a higher pressure. This method is\r\nused for fresh plant material<BR>\r\nthat has a high boiling point such as seeds, roots and wood. It\r\nis also used for fresh plant<BR>\r\nmaterial such as peppermint and spearmint.<BR>\r\nThe crop is cut and placed in a metal distilling tank on a truck.<BR>\r\nSteam is forced through the fresh herbs and the oil droplets are\r\ncarried by the steam<BR>\r\nthrough a vapor pipe at the top of the tank onto a cool condensing\r\nchamber.<BR>\r\nCold Pressing or Expression:<BR>\r\nThis method is mainly used to prepare citrus oils such as orange,\r\nlemon and tangerine.<BR>\r\nOne method involves puncturing the oil glands by rolling the fruit\r\nover sharp projections that<BR>\r\nactually pierce the oil glands. The fruit is then pressed which\r\nremoves the oil from the glands.<BR>\r\nIt is then washed off with a fine spray of water. The juice is\r\nextracted by another tube.<BR>\r\nThe oil is then separated from the water by rotating it at a very\r\nhigh speed.<BR>\r\nAnother method involves separating the peel from the fruits and\r\nthen cold pressing them.<BR>\r\nThe Essential oil is collected along with small amounts of juice,\r\nwhich is separated.<BR>\r\nEnfleurage:<BR>\r\nThis is an old method which was used in the production of perfumes\r\nand pomade extracts for perfumery.<BR>\r\nFlower petals such as rose or jasmine are layered onto warm oils,\r\ncold fat or wax.<BR>\r\nThis process is repeated each day until the base is saturated\r\nwith the Essential oil.<BR>\r\nThe resulting waxes or pastes contain up to 1 percent of Essential\r\noil.<BR>\r\nThe Essential oil is then extracted from the wax with a volatile\r\nliquid such as ethyl alcohol.<BR>\r\nIn the final step the ethyl alcohol is evaporated at low temperatures\r\nand reduced<BR>\r\npressure so that the pure Essential oil remains as a fairly thick\r\nliquid. Cold enfleurage has<BR>\r\nthe advantage that even the most delicate components of the flower\r\noils are preserved.<BR>\r\nThe disadvantages are that it is not very effective and it is\r\nvery expensive.<BR>\r\nFlower oils prepared with this method do not contain terpene-hydrocarbons,\r\nwhich indicates<BR>\r\nthat these compounds are not present as such in the flower, but\r\nform during distillation.<BR>\r\nSolvent Extraction<BR>\r\nThis is the most widely used modern method to prepare oils from\r\nflowers.<BR>\r\nThe petals are mixed into a volatile solvent such as petroleum,\r\nether or benzene,<BR>\r\nuntil the Essential oil is completely dissolved in the solvent.\r\nThe solution is then filtered<BR>\r\nand the solvent is evaporated at reduced pressure. The result\r\nof solvent extraction is a concrete.<BR>\r\nThe solvent is removed from the concrete by vacuum pressure without\r\nthe use of heat to avoid<BR>\r\nany harmful effect to the oil. The concentrated essence that results\r\nis called an absolute.<BR>\r\nAbsolutes are highly concentrated flower products without the\r\nnatural waxes.<BR>\r\nThe main advantage of extraction over distillation is that uniform\r\ntemperatures are maintained<BR>\r\nthroughout the process. High temperatures during the distillation\r\nprocess can produce altered<BR>\r\nchemical composition of the oil which alters the natural odor.\r\nHowever, this method is expensive<BR>\r\ncompared to distillation, and chemicals or solvents used in the\r\nprocess may still be present after evaporation.<BR>\r\n\'Glycerin will extract the following - sugars, enzymes (dilute),\r\nglucosides, bitter compounds,<BR>\r\nsaponins (dilute), and tannins. Absolute alcohol will extract\r\nthe following - alkaloids (some),<BR>\r\nglycosides, volatile oils, waxes, resins, fats, some tannins,\r\nbalsam, sugars, and vitamins.\'<BR>\r\nyou would use the solvent that will give you the healing properties\r\nthat you need out of<BR>\r\nthe plant. And for those that don\'t like the alcohol taste, or\r\nbite, the tincture can be mixed<BR>\r\nin hot water and left for a few minutes to evaporate most of the\r\nalcohol off.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">HOW TO PREPARE YOUR OWN INFUSED OILS AT HOME<BR>\r\nThere is nothing more satisfying than gathering a basket of fresh\r\njasmine, honeysuckle or<BR>\r\nrose blossoms on a warm summers day and then preparing your own\r\ninfused oil.<BR>\r\nThere are three methods for preparing an infused herbal oil. You\r\ncan use fresh or dried herbs.<BR>\r\nFlowers are best fresh, although the perfume of some flowers intensifies\r\nwith drying such<BR>\r\nas gardenia, daphne and boronia. If using fresh, double the quantity\r\nas all recipes given<BR>\r\nare for dried herbs. If using fresh herbs for any of these methods\r\nleave the herbs to wilt for<BR>\r\nsix hours to reduce their water content which will spoil the final\r\nproduct.<BR>\r\nWATERBATH METHOD<BR>\r\n15 gm (1/2 oz) dried or if fresh use 30 gm (1 oz) herb (this is\r\nthe total amount so if you are<BR>\r\nusing a blend make sure you do not have more than this) 1 cup\r\nof oil<BR>\r\nMeasure the herbs and oil and mix the oil to the herbs in a stainless\r\nsteel bowl.<BR>\r\nHeat over water bath (a saucepan 1/4 filled with water) also known\r\nas a double boiler,<BR>\r\nwhich should be simmering. Make sure the bowl is not sitting on\r\nthe bottom of the pot but is<BR>\r\nfloating in the water. Keep the lid on the oil. Stir occasionally\r\nand simmer for 30 minutes.<BR>\r\nWatch the oil does not get too hot. It should not smoke or bubble.\r\nIt can burn easily and<BR>\r\nwill develop an acrid smell if it overheats, which is very difficult\r\nto disguise.<BR>\r\nStrain through four layers of butter muslin or some other very\r\nfine non-metal strainer.<BR>\r\nStrain twice if necessary as it is important to get all herbs\r\nout of the oil to prevent the<BR>\r\nherbal oil from going rancid or moldy. Essential oils can be added\r\nat this stage for perfume<BR>\r\nand added therapeutic benefits.<BR>\r\nSOLAR METHOD<BR>\r\nUse the same quantities of herbs and oil as for the waterbath\r\nmethod or approximately 3<BR>\r\ntablespoons of finely cut herbs to 300ml (10 oz) of oil. The quantity\r\nof herb can be increased<BR>\r\nto produce a stronger oil.<BR>\r\nPut the herbs in a jar with a tight fitting lid and pour over\r\nthe oil. Make surethe herbs are<BR>\r\ncompletely covered with oil. Add one tablespoon of apple cider\r\nvinegar or white wine to<BR>\r\nhelp break down the plant material. Leave the jar to sit in the\r\nsun all day and in a warm<BR>\r\ncupboard at night for two weeks. Strain through four layers of\r\nmuslin. This process can be<BR>\r\nrepeated two to three times to give a stronger oil.<BR>\r\nThe final product should be strong enough to leave an aroma when\r\nmassaged on the skin.<BR>\r\nAlways test infused oils on the skin. Don\'t rely on just your\r\nnose.<BR>\r\nCROCKPOT METHOD<BR>\r\nUse the same quantities of herbs and oil as for Waterbath method.<BR>\r\nPlace the herbs and oil in a crockpot and leave on a low heat\r\nfor two hours.<BR>\r\nFollow the recipe above for straining.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">TO PRESERVE OILS<BR>\r\nThis is only necessary if you are preparing large quantities that\r\nyou intend to store.<BR>\r\n1.

Be warned - though\r\nmost of the ointments<BR>\r\ndiscussed in this section are fairly innocuous, some of them are\r\npoisonous and may be lethal.<BR>\r\nBy including them in this work, there is in no way advocating\r\nuse of such hazardous mixtures.<BR>\r\nThese ointments form a part of herb magic of long-gone days, and\r\nso are included here solely<BR>\r\nfor their historical interest.<BR>\r\nMAKING OINTMENTS<BR>\r\nOintments are easily made.<BR>\r\nThey consist simply of herbs or oils and a base.<BR>\r\nIn the past, hog\'s lard was the preferred base because it was\r\nreadily available, but vegetable<BR>\r\nshortening or beeswax produces the best results.<BR>\r\nThe base must be a greasy substance that melts over heat but is\r\nsolid at room temperature.<BR>\r\nSome herbalists actually use dinosaur fat (I.e., Vaseline, which\r\nis prepared from petroleum)!<BR>\r\nThere are two basic ways to create magical ointments.<BR>\r\nTHE SHORTENING METHOD<BR>\r\nGently heat four parts shortening over low heat until liquefied.\r\nWatch that it doesn\'t burn.<BR>\r\nAdd one part dried herbal mixture, blend with a wooden spoon until\r\nthoroughly mixed, and<BR>\r\ncontinue heating until the shortening has extracted the scent.\r\nYou should be able to smell it in the air.<BR>\r\nStrain through cheesecloth into a heat-proof container, such as\r\na canning jar.<BR>\r\nAdd one-half teaspoon tincture of benzoin to each pint of ointment\r\nas a natural preservative.<BR>\r\nStore in a cool, dark place, such as the refrigerator. Ointments\r\nshould last for weeks or months.<BR>\r\nDiscard any that turn moldy, and lay in a fresh batch.<BR>\r\nTHE BEESWAX METHOD<BR>\r\nThis process creates a more cosmetic ointment without a heavy,\r\ngreasy feeling.<BR>\r\nIt is best to prepare it with oils rather than herbs, as it is\r\ndifficult to strain.<BR>\r\nIf possible, use unbleached beeswax. If not, use what you can\r\nfind.<BR>\r\nChip it with a large, sharp knife so that you can pack it into\r\na measuring cup.<BR>\r\nPlace one-fourth cup or so of beeswax in the top of a double boiler\r\n(such as a coffee can<BR>\r\nset into a larger pot of water). Add about one-fourth cup olive,\r\nhazelnut, sesame or some<BR>\r\nother vegetable oil. Stir with a wooden spoon until the wax has\r\nmelted into the oil.<BR>\r\nRemove from the heat and let cool very slightly, until it has\r\njust begun to thicken.<BR>\r\n(This step is taken so that the hot wax won\'t evaporate the oils.)<BR>\r\nNow add the mixed oils to the wax.<BR>\r\nStir thoroughly with a wooden spoon and pour into a heat-proof\r\ncontainer.<BR>\r\nLabel and store in the usual way.<BR>\r\nIn the recipes that follow, the recommended method of preparation\r\nwill be mentioned.<BR>\r\nEMPOWERING OINTMENTS<BR>\r\nOnce the ointment is made and has cooled in its jar, empower it\r\nwith its particular magical need.<BR>\r\nThis vital step, remember, directs the energy within the ointment,\r\nreadying it for your ritual use.<BR>\r\nUSING OINTMENTS<BR>\r\nOintments are usually rubbed onto the body to effect various magical\r\nchanges.<BR>\r\nAs with oils, this is done with visualization and with the knowledge\r\nthat the ointment will do its work.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">HEALING OINTMENT<BR>\r\n4 drops Cedarwood 2 drops Sandalwood<BR>\r\n1 drop Eucalyptus 1 drop Cinnamon<BR>\r\nAdd to the melted beeswax/oil base, cool, and anoint the body\r\nto speed healing as needed.<BR>\r\nDo not apply to wounds, burns or broken skin!</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">HEX-BREAKER OINTMENT<BR>\r\n3 parts Galangal 2 parts Ginger root, dried<BR>\r\n2 parts Vetivert 1 part Thistle<BR>\r\nSteep the herbs in shortening, strain, cool, and anoint the body\r\nat night.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">LOVE OINTMENT<BR>\r\n4 drops Ylang-Ylang 2 drops Lavender<BR>\r\n1 drop Cardamom 1 drop Vanilla extract<BR>\r\nAdd the oils to the beeswax/oil base.<BR>\r\nMake in the usual way and anoint the body when looking for love.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">LUST OINTMENT<BR>\r\n3 parts Galangal 2 parts Dill<BR>\r\n1 part Ginger 1 part Peppermint 1 whole Vanilla bean<BR>\r\nPrepare with shortening in the usual way.

Cover tightly. Place the jar in\r\na warm, sunny spot.<BR>\r\nIn Europe and the Mediterranean the jars are placed in sandboxes\r\nto attract<BR>\r\ngreater amounts of heat. Let the oil/herb mixture infuse for two\r\nweeks.<BR>\r\nPeople always ask why the oil doesn\'t go rancid sitting out in\r\nthe hot sun.<BR>\r\nAccording to natural laws, it should. But for some magickal reason,\r\nit seldom does.<BR>\r\nI believe it\'s because of the alchemical fusion of the sun, the\r\nherbs, and the oil.<BR>\r\nBut once strained, the oil will definitely go rancid very quickly\r\nif left in the hot sun.<BR>\r\nAt the end of two weeks, strain the herbs, rebottle your beautiful\r\nherbal oil, and store it<BR>\r\nin a cool dark area. If you wish a stronger oil, add a fresh batch\r\nof herbs to the oil, and<BR>\r\ninfuse for two more weeks. This will double the potency of your\r\nmedicinal oil.<BR>\r\nOVEN EXTRACTION METHOD<BR>\r\nPlace the oil/herb mixture in a pan with a tight-fitting lid or\r\nin glass canning jars.<BR>\r\nPut the pan and/or jars in a larger pan with sufficient water\r\nto cover up the bottom half of the<BR>\r\ncontainer. Turn the oven on the lowest temperature possible and\r\nallow the herbs and oil to<BR>\r\ninfuse for several hours. Check frequently to prevent the oil\r\nfrom overheating and burning.<BR>\r\nDOUBLE BOILER METHOD<BR>\r\nPlace the herbs and oil in a double boiler, cover with a tight-fitting\r\nlid, and bring to a low simmer.<BR>\r\nSlowly heat for one-half to one hour, checking frequently to be\r\nsure the oil is not overheating.<BR>\r\nThen lower the heat, and the longer the infusion, the better the\r\noil.<BR>\r\nThis is a quick and simple method that appeals to many modern-day\r\nherbalists.<BR>\r\nOil heats up very quickly. Be mindful of the temperature.<BR>\r\nYour preparation can quickly go from a nice herbal oil infusion\r\nto deep-fried Comfrey leaves.<BR>\r\nCROCKPOT AND ELECTRIC OVEN ROASTER METHOD<BR>\r\nBoth Crockpots and electric oven roasters allow for a long, slow\r\ncooking process.<BR>\r\nThe roaster is most often used by small professional companies\r\nmaking quality herbal products.<BR>\r\nThe herbs can macerate in the oil for a long period of time (two\r\nto four weeks) and the resulting<BR>\r\noil is of a superior quality. Electric roasters can often be found\r\nquite inexpensively at bargain<BR>\r\nshops and second-hand stores.<BR>\r\nPlace the herbs and oil in the Crockpot or roaster and turn to\r\nthe lowest heat. Place the lid<BR>\r\non and let the mixture steep for the desired length of time. The\r\nheat is generally higher in the<BR>\r\nCrockpot and usually two to four hours is sufficient to prepare\r\ngood-quality herbal oils.<BR>\r\nCheck frequently to protect against overheating and burning. In\r\nthe roaster, the herb/oil mixture<BR>\r\ncan steep for two to four weeks. It gives a superior, dark-green\r\nherbal oil.<BR>\r\nThere are several approaches to creating a magickal herbal oil.\r\nOne, the most difficult, is to use<BR>\r\nan extractor and extract the pure essential oils yourself It involves\r\ncomplex equipment, but is<BR>\r\nrewarding for the serious practitioner. The results are pure,\r\nessential oil. There are several<BR>\r\napproaches to creating a magickal herbal oil. One, the most difficult,\r\nis to use an extractor and<BR>\r\nextract the pure essential oils yourself. It involves complex\r\nequipment, but is rewarding for the<BR>\r\nserious practitioner. The results are pure, essential oils which\r\ncan be used in a variety of ways.<BR>\r\nPure oils of an essential, volatile nature may also be purchased\r\ncommercially. It is important to<BR>\r\nknow that many of these are too strong to use directly upon the\r\nskin, but make excellent incense<BR>\r\nby merely placing a couple drops upon a burning piece of charcoal.\r\nThese oils may also be used<BR>\r\nwith a fixative, or carrier, such as olive, sunflower, or other\r\noils.<BR>\r\nFIXATIVE OIL<BR>\r\nThe simplest means of making your own oil is to begin with a fixative\r\noil. This is placed in a sturdy<BR>\r\npan, and to it are added herbaceous parts which have a high content\r\nof natural oil within the<BR>\r\ncellular structure. You may wish to use the flowering parts, or\r\nleaves, and in some cases the root.<BR>\r\nGently bring this to warmth, stirring carefully. Never allow it\r\nto boil, and you may accomplish<BR>\r\nexcellent results by avoiding even a &quot;hot&quot; temperature.\r\nThis process may be repeated several<BR>\r\ntimes over a day or more.<BR>\r\nThus, the natural oils within the herb are released into solution\r\nwith the fixative, as they are soluble in oil.<BR>\r\nThere are many recipes for oils. The herbs are chosen according\r\nto their meaning and attributes.<BR>\r\nA personal mixture may be made by combining equal parts of three\r\nherbs: one for the<BR>\r\nSun sign, one for the Moon sign, and one or the ascendant, or\r\nrising sign.<BR>\r\nOne might also make a protective oil, by combining several herbs\r\nknown for their ability to<BR>\r\ngive protection, the individual choices made by preferences of\r\nscent. It is important to<BR>\r\nexperiment. One means of trial and error for finding compatible\r\nscents is to take small<BR>\r\namounts of the dried herbs and grind them together. Smell deeply\r\nof the aroma, and feel<BR>\r\nhow it suits you. To make these, fill a jar to within &frac12;\r\ninch from the top with almond oil.<BR>\r\nThen add crushed herbs till it is full. Steep in a sunny window\r\nfor 1 moon cycle, rotating each day.<BR>\r\nStrain out the herb and bottle. These can be added to bath salts,\r\nsoaps or used for anointing candles.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">OILS ESSAY<BR>\r\nRose is used for love magic. Real essential oil of roses (rose\r\notto or attar of roses)<BR>\r\nis so expensive that most people use either essential oil of rose\r\ngeranium or artificial<BR>\r\nrose oil as a substitute. Rose has nothing at all to do with raw\r\npower or domination.<BR>\r\nFrankincense is a spiritual scent and is also used for power.\r\nIt could be used in<BR>\r\nEssence of Bend-Over, but it is a little on the &quot;nice&quot;\r\nside for it to carry the entire<BR>\r\nweight of true domination work in this formula.<BR>\r\nHoneysuckle is primarily used as a fragrance, and, being floral,\r\nit is a frequent<BR>\r\ningredient in love potions. The plant itself is a vine that has\r\nno strong magical<BR>\r\nconnotations that I know, and what\'s stranger, real essential\r\noil of honeysuckle is unstable,<BR>\r\nso most makers use the artificial, synthetic aroma.<BR>\r\nLooking at honeysuckle from the perspective of the &quot;doctrine\r\nof signatures,&quot;<BR>\r\none could say that it grows upon trees and somehow dominates them,\r\nbut it certainly does not<BR>\r\nmake them bend to its will -- and other vines of similar twining\r\nhabit, such as periwinkle,<BR>\r\nare always used in love-and-marriage formulas, because of their\r\nclinging natures.<BR>\r\nIn short, honeysuckle might be good for love-domination (as an\r\ningredient in Follow me)<BR>\r\nVetivert is one of the five &quot;Asian Grasses&quot; that is\r\nused (in a very small proportion) in Van<BR>\r\nVan Oil and, as such, it is a spiritual cleanser and luck-changer.\r\nIt is not particularly associated<BR>\r\nwith efforts of will or domination. So this recipe for Bend-Over,\r\nalthough very commonly<BR>\r\nencountered in the Anglo-Saxon world of aromatherapy and playful\r\nspell-cookery -- and<BR>\r\ndespite its wonderful fragrance -- is not exactly what I\'d call\r\na powerful aid to domination<BR>\r\nor willful control of another\'s mind or activities through the\r\ndoctrine of sympathetic magic as<BR>\r\ndeveloped by root-workers. A look through any good magical herbal\r\nwill reveal that there are<BR>\r\nthree herbs often recommended for control and domination. They\r\nare<BR>\r\ncalamus root licorice root bergamot leaf or essential oil of bergamot<BR>\r\nCalamus root produces an essential oil and it is also available\r\nas chips or powder,<BR>\r\nwhich can be steeped in a carrier oil.<BR>\r\nLicorice root is available as chips or powder, to steep in carrier\r\noil<BR>\r\nBergamot is a citrus-relative. Its essential oil must be diluted\r\nin a carrier oil because<BR>\r\nsome folks are skin-sensitive or allergic to it in strong concentrations.<BR>\r\nCalamus root is white and licorice root is a deep yellow-brown.\r\nWhen the two are placed<BR>\r\nwith essential oils of bergamot and calmus root and a few grains\r\nof frankincense in a<BR>\r\ncarrier such as almond oil that has been tinted a rich yellow-orange,\r\nthe result is impressive<BR>\r\nboth visually and in terms of fragrance.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">9/6/01<BR>\r\n</FONT>\r\n\r\n</BODY>',

Let it soak for nine minutes, then sprinkle the\r\nwater throughout the <BR>\r\nhouse while visualizing a calm environment. Harmony should be\r\nrestored.<BR>\r\nFor in-house disturbances, heat three cups of water until just\r\nboiling. <BR>\r\nPut three teaspoons of dried valerian root in a teapot and pour\r\nthe hot water over this. <BR>\r\nLet steep 13 minutes, strain and sprinkle the mixture around the\r\nhome. <BR>\r\nThis should halt the strife.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">POWER MEDITATION<BR>\r\nYou should begin by considering your own body, particularly your\r\nbreathing. This is <BR>\r\nnot difficult, merely finding yourself a comfortable chair in\r\nwhich you can sit without falling<BR>\r\nasleep. You should try to find a place where you will not be disturbed.\r\nNot because<BR>\r\ndisturbances are dangerous, but because you may find yourself\r\nenjoying the relaxed state so<BR>\r\nmuch that being brought suddenly out of it by an offending family\r\nmember may cause you to <BR>\r\nlose your temper.<BR>\r\nOnce you have found your spot, sit quietly for about 10 minutes\r\nat a time. That is how<BR>\r\nyou start. Just by sitting and doing nothing, and while sitting\r\ntry to notice how your body<BR>\r\nreacts. Notice that twitch you have? Feel your lungs filling with\r\nair, rising and falling,<BR>\r\npushing out our rib cage and letting it fall back in.<BR>\r\nAs you sit, notice all of these things. Your body has certain\r\nplaces that are naturally<BR>\r\ntense. You will hear things you normally ignore. That is not really\r\nso strange.<BR>\r\nEveryone experiences it when they are falling asleep at night\r\n(i.e.. the creaking of the<BR>\r\nhouse). Pay very close attention to all of these things and you\r\nwill discover something<BR>\r\ninteresting. The more you listen to your own body, the less you\r\nare bothered by the <BR>\r\nthoughts of the day. This is because your conscious mind can only\r\nhandle one piece of data at a time.<BR>\r\nIf you are studying intently, you are unaware of what is going\r\non around you. The more you<BR>\r\npractice, the more effective your mind becomes at blocking out\r\nunwelcome stimuli.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">HAPPY HOME SPELL<BR>\r\nIf moon is travelling from new to full, you want to bring love\r\ninto the home. <BR>\r\nIf the moon is travelling from full to new, you want to push negativity\r\nout from the home. <BR>\r\nTake half an onion, close your eyes, saying: <BR>\r\n&quot;I empower you to collect all negativity In this house.&quot;<BR>\r\nImagine the onion turning into a giant vacuum cleaner, sucking\r\nup all the negative <BR>\r\nenergy in your house.

My inner\r\nrejuvenating powers are <BR>\r\nfully and completely unleashed to flow freely throughout my total\r\nbeing. <BR>\r\nEach day, my mind and body absorb the abundance of youthful energy\r\nthat is constantly <BR>\r\nbeing unleashed within my being. Whenever I envision myself enveloped\r\nwith the colorful <BR>\r\nglow of radiant energy, I will immediately become invigorated\r\nand fully empowered.&quot; <BR>\r\nThis rejuvenation procedure can be repeated daily, or as often\r\nas you wish. <BR>\r\nYou may want to place a small, self-adhesive star or other reminder\r\non your mirror, <BR>\r\ncomputer, or TV as a cue to periodically re-activate the inner\r\nflow of rejuvenating energy. <BR>\r\nWith practice, the process of combining visualization with affirmations\r\nand tapping into the <BR>\r\ndormant powers of rejuvenation within you will become a natural,\r\nspontaneous and continuous function.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">9/9/01</FONT>\r\n\r\n</BODY>',

They aren\'t safe even if you have never seen\r\nthem being sprayed either,<BR>\r\nsystemic poisons are injected or placed around the roots of the\r\nplant and will result in the same<BR>\r\nexposure to these toxins. Even organically grown roses are occasionally\r\nsprayed with sulfur and<BR>\r\nother solutions to keep fungi at bay, so this will affect the\r\nworking. Sulfur will actually oppose this<BR>\r\nworking with its repelling tendencies. Ideally, the roses will\r\nbe your own, or from a garden you are<BR>\r\nfamiliar with so you know that it has been at least two weeks\r\nsince any sprays have been applied.<BR>\r\nI spray mine with a mixture of Comfrey, manure, compost, and baking\r\nsoda, fermented together and<BR>\r\nmade into a tea, and NO WAY would I recommend collecting dew off\r\nof them for a couple days<BR>\r\nafter the spray! To collect the dew, have a very clean, well wrung\r\nout, natural sea sponge or<BR>\r\ncolor-free cellulose sponge. Armed with your sponge and a small\r\nbottle, go to the roses late at<BR>\r\nnight or very early in the morning, during the waxing moon is\r\nbest. Dab the dew from the flowers<BR>\r\nand some leaves and occasionally wring the sponge out into the\r\nbottle.<BR>\r\nThis shouldn\'t take long, maybe 15 minutes to collect what is\r\nneeded, (depending on the<BR>\r\nhumidity in your area) but get extra as long as you are there\r\nfor future use.<BR>\r\nSeparate the excess from what you will be using for any immediate\r\nworkings.<BR>\r\nTo the bottle that you will be putting up for storage add:<BR>\r\n3 drops of ethyl alcohol, brandy, or rubbing alcohol OR 9 drops\r\nof commercial vanilla extract<BR>\r\nAND a small pinch of sea salt.<BR>\r\nThis will keep it fresh for several months, and I like to refrigerate\r\nmine as well.<BR>\r\nExposure to light will ruin the solution, as with many extracts\r\nand infusions, so keep it in the dark<BR>\r\nor in an amber or cobalt glass phial. If you cannot collect Rose\r\nDew in this manner, substitute<BR>\r\nrose water in your spells.

Melt this\r\nslowly in a double<BR>\r\nboiler, or in a pan over boiling water, and mix the shavings with\r\na bit of water so they<BR>\r\ndon\'t stick together in the pan. When you have a nice, smooth\r\nconsistency to work<BR>\r\nwith, you can add empowered ingredients. Good ingredients to add\r\nwould be:<BR>\r\n-money herbs and oils, such as patchouli, mint, basil, cinquefoil,\r\nginger, sage,<BR>\r\nTonka, nutmeg, oak moss and lemon balm.<BR>\r\n-empowered gold glitter<BR>\r\n-Green vegetable coloring (or whatever color you correspond money\r\nand prosperity with)<BR>\r\nOnce you have added your ingredients, let the mixture cool slightly\r\nuntil you can start<BR>\r\nforming it in your hands. You can now roll it into balls, wrap\r\nthem up in some<BR>\r\ncheesecloth or muslin, and let them harden.<BR>\r\nAn easier way to make a quick money soap is to purchase some melt\r\n&amp; pour glycerin from<BR>\r\na craft store - I think they even have it at Wal-Mart. It\'s sold\r\nin blocks. Melt the blocks in<BR>\r\nglassware over the stove or on the microwave until it is liquid.<BR>\r\nAdd your empowered ingredients quickly, as melt &amp; pour sets\r\nfast.<BR>\r\nNext, pour the mixture into a mold (these can be purchased also,\r\nor you can make<BR>\r\nmolds from just about anything from margarine tubs to juice cans\r\nto empty toilet paper<BR>\r\nrolls with foil on one end) and let the soap set.<BR>\r\nMelt and pour soap is easier to work with, because you can add\r\nyour ingredients much<BR>\r\neasier, and you don\'t end up with so much soap afterwards. You\r\ncan also make bars<BR>\r\nthat are individual to your needs. For example, try pouring half\r\nthe mixture into the mold,<BR>\r\nadd a toy coin or a plastic dollar sign which you have empowered,\r\nthen pour the rest into the mold.<BR>\r\nWhen hardened, you will have a soap with an empowered item in\r\nthe middle of it.<BR>\r\nYou could even put a charged stone in the middle of the soap.<BR>\r\nCreating the soap with your individuality only makes it more powerful.<BR>\r\nThe best part? The above directions can be used for any magickal\r\ngoal, not just money!<BR>\r\nOne more thing, when using your soap, concentrate clearly on your\r\nintentions and visualize!<BR>\r\nFor money, visualize the soap attracting the money to you.<BR>\r\nFor illness, visualize the soap cleaning the illness out of you.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">HOLY WATER<BR>\r\nIngredients: 1 tsp. of rose water 3 tbsp. sea salt or Kosher salt\r\n1 small bowl of spring water*<BR>\r\n1 clean glass container 1 new compact mirror 1 small storage glass\r\nbottle**<BR>\r\nNote: You can buy the bottled water as long as you know that it\'s\r\nreally spring water.<BR>\r\nBut it\'s best if you get the water from a running stream or other\r\n&quot;live&quot; body of water that you<BR>\r\nknow the water is clean.

After a moment, hold your hands over\r\nthe <BR>\r\nassembled tools and say something like the following (Feel Free\r\nTo Improvise): <BR>\r\n&quot;I Charge you, tools of the elements to sweep my dwelling\r\nclean of <BR>\r\nall ill and bane.

We dedicate them to helping us in our work of healing<BR>\r\nmeditation, divination and inner growth.&quot; <BR>\r\nThis next part of the ritual is to banish any negative energies\r\naround and in the store or dwelling. <BR>\r\nThe group forms a procession walking counter clockwise through\r\nevery room in the store or <BR>\r\ndwelling, carrying the smudge stick and the lit black candle saying:<BR>\r\n&quot;We banish from this place all pain and negativity. We neutralize\r\nnegative or mischievous <BR>\r\nentities from this place.

If you have a flower or crystal to leave in each\r\nroom as <BR>\r\nyou exit, do so. The group forms a circle around the table where\r\nyou <BR>\r\nfirst began. One person (the one in charge) leads the group. She<BR>\r\ntakes the dish of salt, and moving clockwise, leads the group<BR>\r\nthroughout each room saying: <BR>\r\n&quot;By the powers of Earth, I cleanse this dwelling.&quot; <BR>\r\nThe group is to follow her and repeat what she says. <BR>\r\nMake sure to do all the corners, windows, doorways of each room\r\nas <BR>\r\nyou go. Imagine, seeing the salt burning away negativity as you<BR>\r\nsprinkle and toss it. Your purification will be as strong as your\r\nvisualization. <BR>\r\nNext, set the salt down and pick up the censor or incense, carry\r\nit <BR>\r\nfrom room to room (The same route you used with the salt...walking<BR>\r\nclockwise...group following and repeating) Be sure to hold it\r\nbefore <BR>\r\nall windows and doors, and in the corners of each room.

Take the lit white candle on the same route.<BR>\r\nAgain, visualize moving clockwise and holding the flame before<BR>\r\nwindows and doors, seeing it shining forth with magical power,<BR>\r\nburning away negativity. As you go say: <BR>\r\n&quot;By the powers of Fire, I cleanse this place.&quot; <BR>\r\nReplace the candle on the tale and take up the bowl of holy water.<BR>\r\nSprinkle the holy water throughout the house, in every corner,\r\nand at <BR>\r\nexits and entrances.

The representations can be anything you\'d\r\nlike pictures, statues, <BR>\r\nsome kind of craft, etc. Usually, it is best if you can hang the\r\nrepresentation by or across <BR>\r\nfrom the door, but it is not necessary. We have our house guardian\r\nstatues <BR>\r\n(two small gargoyles) sitting on top of a bookcase in the living\r\nroom. <BR>\r\nPutting them near the doors is just for your mind to reaffirm\r\nthat they are protecting the home, <BR>\r\nbut if you feel comfortable placing them somewhere else, then\r\ndo. <BR>\r\nA cleansed white candle for each guardian. <BR>\r\nA sage smudge stick or other cleansing incense like sandalwood\r\nor just sage in its raw form.<BR>\r\nBefore calling house guardians to guard your home, you should\r\ngive your home a good cleansing. <BR>\r\nTake the smudge stick (be sure you have a bowl to catch the ashes)\r\nand begin at the front door. <BR>\r\nLight the smudged and say a few words such as:<BR>\r\n&quot;As I walk this house May it be cleansed of all negativity&quot;<BR>\r\nStart walking around the house clockwise. <BR>\r\nCircle the smudge counter clockwise or just in a straight line\r\nin front of you towards the walls. <BR>\r\nFeel all negative energy flowing out, pushing it through the walls.<BR>\r\nWhen you come to a window, bar it by literally pulling the smudge\r\nstick back and forth over the <BR>\r\nwindow like you are tracing bars on it. Say something like:<BR>\r\n&quot;I bar this portal from allowing anything to enter&quot;<BR>\r\nIgnore inside doors, like doors to bedrooms. Go into all the rooms\r\nand bar all windows.<BR>\r\nWhen you come to an outside door, do not bar it. <BR>\r\nDraw a circle around the doorframe three times saying something\r\nlike:<BR>\r\n&quot;May no negative energies enter. If a negative person enters,<BR>\r\nMay they leave their Negativity outside&quot;<BR>\r\nIf you have stairs, when you come to them, go up and do the other\r\nfloor (s) then <BR>\r\ncome back down and finish the lower floor. <BR>\r\nYou should always end the cleansing right back where you started,\r\nat the front door. <BR>\r\nWhen you get back to the door, say a finalizing comment like:<BR>\r\n&quot;This house is cleansed. So mote it be&quot;<BR>\r\nIf you have a storage attic, one you can\'t climb into very well,\r\nbar the entrance to it and just <BR>\r\nmake sure that anyone who goes up there wears a protection amulet\r\nor has their shields up. <BR>\r\nNow take your house guardian representations and the candles to\r\nthe place your family spends <BR>\r\nmost of its time together. In most families, it is the dining\r\nroom table, or other place you eat your food. <BR>\r\nSet a candle before each representation. Now, spirits are everywhere\r\nin every house and you are <BR>\r\nsimply calling a few who would like to help protect your home.\r\nThat is why it is important to <BR>\r\ncleanse the house first so no unwanted spirits are there. Light\r\nthe first candle having in mind <BR>\r\nwhich door you want the guardian to protect. Say something like:<BR>\r\n&quot;I welcome a spirit of this house to Guard and protect all\r\nwho dwell here&quot;<BR>\r\nRepeat this with the other guardians if you have more than one.\r\nWhen you are done, take a <BR>\r\nmoment to meditate with them, then take them to their designated\r\npositions within the house <BR>\r\nand extinguish the candles. These candles are to be used only\r\nto call upon the guardians. <BR>\r\nYou should introduce the family, including all pets to the guardians.<BR>\r\nTo do this, light their candles and call them, always where you\r\ncalled upon them in the first place. <BR>\r\nThen introduce your family one at a time. If you have a spouse\r\nwho wishes not to participate, <BR>\r\nthen tell the guardians that s/he does belong in the house and\r\nto protect them as well. <BR>\r\nYou can call the guardians at any time in the above manner. It\r\nis also good to meditate with them. <BR>\r\nLight the candles, call them, then meditate and you will see and\r\nhear them. <BR>\r\nIt is a good idea to get to know them. On May Day, the Romans\r\nwould do a ritual for <BR>\r\ntheir house guardians. So on this day, do something extra special\r\nfor them. If you are <BR>\r\ngoing to have company for more than a few days, tell the guardians.\r\nThe guardians will <BR>\r\nthen protect them also. Always leave offerings out for the guardians\r\nwhen you call them, <BR>\r\nwhen you feel they have done something good for you, and on the\r\nSabbats and Esbats. <BR>\r\nThese offerings can be a small dish of left over food and drink\r\nfrom dinner. <BR>\r\nPut it in a place where pets and children cannot reach it. In\r\nthe morning, you will find the <BR>\r\nfood there, but the essence of the food, its nutrition and often\r\ntimes its taste, will be gone. <BR>\r\nAnytime you are going to do something different in the house,\r\ninform the guardians first. <BR>\r\nIf you are expecting a child, getting a new pet, redecorating,\r\nor just having a party, <BR>\r\ntell them out of respect so they are not wondering what is going\r\non! <BR>\r\nThe most important thing to remember about your guardians is that\r\nthey normally will <BR>\r\nstay in the house you called them in. If you move, tell them and\r\ntell them their services <BR>\r\nwill no longer be needed.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">AN HERBAL PROTECTION SPELL<BR>\r\nGet a piece of white cloth.

It should be glass\r\nbecause glass is made from sand. <BR>\r\nThoroughly wash and dry the jar, removing any labels. It must\r\nhave a close-fitting lid as well.<BR>\r\n* Equal quantities of two different colors of sand. Some types\r\ninclude fine grayish-white beach sand; <BR>\r\nyellowish coral sand; orangish sand from the desert; red sand\r\nfrom volcanic areas; black <BR>\r\nobsidian sand and many others. (Many of these can be bought at\r\nplant stores or pet stores. <BR>\r\nAlso try aquarium sops and builders to find different sand types.<BR>\r\nThey do not have to be beautiful just of differing types!)<BR>\r\n* A spoon. * Two small bowls to hold the sands.<BR>\r\nBefore you begin, pour one type of sand into the bottle until\r\nit\'s just over half filled. <BR>\r\nEmpty this sand into one dish. Call it &quot;Sand 1&quot; (for\r\nreference.) <BR>\r\nClean the bottle and repeat with &quot;Sand 2,&quot; emptying\r\nit into its own bowl. <BR>\r\nNow you are ready. Hold your protective hand over &quot;Sand 1.&quot;\r\nLook down at it. <BR>\r\nSee it humming and writhing with protective, projective energy.\r\nTouch the sand. <BR>\r\nVisualize it emitting sparks of bright white light that ensnare\r\nnegativity and draw it inward. <BR>\r\nCharge it with personal power. Repeat with &quot;Sand 2&quot;.\r\nPlace the bottle before you. <BR>\r\nScoop out a level spoonful of sand. Pour this into the jar while\r\nsaying the following words:<BR>\r\n&quot;Trap of sand Trap the ill.<BR>\r\nTrap the bane and Evil will.&quot;<BR>\r\nSo mote it be, it is done!</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">PROTECTION SPELL<BR>\r\nYou will need a single yellow candle (large if you can find one\r\n- preferably unscented beeswax) <BR>\r\nfor this spell. Begin by standing up with the candle placed on\r\nthe ground in front of you. <BR>\r\nRemove your shoes to accentuate the connection to the earth. <BR>\r\nRelax your entire body and feel the energies flow up from the\r\nground, <BR>\r\nvisualizing a warm yellow light flowing up your body. <BR>\r\nWith your eyes slightly closed and the mouth relaxed (I tend to\r\nrest the <BR>\r\ntongue on the roof of my mouth) allow the subtle force of energy\r\nto raise your arms. <BR>\r\nVisualize the floating waves of yellow energy coaxing your arms\r\nup to the point <BR>\r\nwhere your palms are facing each other with roughly two inches\r\nbetween them. <BR>\r\nGently rotate your hands without touching until you feel the build\r\nup of a \'ball\' <BR>\r\nbetween them. Whilst maintaining the ball, sit down before the\r\ncandle. <BR>\r\nWait a moment, let the energy cultivate itself. <BR>\r\nNow move your hands (visualized as glowing a bright yellow) towards\r\nyour body, <BR>\r\nletting the energy flow into you core at the \'dan tien point\'\r\ntwo inches below the navel.<BR>\r\nAs the energy flows in visualize the protective energy of the\r\nsun covering you and <BR>\r\nshielding you from all darkness. Think of hope, and as you do\r\nso let the energy flow <BR>\r\nup to the solar plexus, then down again with every alternate breath\r\n- making a cycle. <BR>\r\nNow - slowly - open your eyes widely and allow the palms of your\r\nhands to touch. <BR>\r\nVisualize your self \'borrowing and storing\' the protective energy\r\nyou have raised. <BR>\r\nNow light the candle. Let the light become the sun\'s power before\r\nyou. Open your energized <BR>\r\nhands and place them around the candle flame (being careful not\r\nto burn yourself!) <BR>\r\nand let them warm. Now come the words. You must choose an appropriate\r\nname for your <BR>\r\nsun god. Many choose Apollo or Ra - powerful masculine protectors.<BR>\r\nI choose the Japanese god of the sun Amaterasu, a woman. <BR>\r\nA symbol of motherhood, the sun, protection. <BR>\r\nAs I place my hands about <BR>\r\nI protect the precious light, <BR>\r\nSo to does Amaterasu <BR>\r\nGoddess of the Sun, <BR>\r\nI feel her warm protection about me soft and bright.<BR>\r\nAs the candle\'s light burns, feel the light inside of you glow\r\ntoo - sense the connection <BR>\r\nmaintained by the infinite. I advise sitting in this state for\r\nup to twenty minutes (or however <BR>\r\nlong it takes you - everyone is an individual) until you are completely\r\nrelaxed and comfortable - <BR>\r\nshrouded in the sun god\'s light. When you gain the sensation that\r\nyou are protected from within, <BR>\r\nextinguish the candle and place it on a sunny window ledge.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">PLANET PROTECTION SHIELD <BR>\r\nThis is protection spell that actually calls upon the all the\r\ngreat celestial bodies in a <BR>\r\nsolar system so this is pretty powerful spell.<BR>\r\nItems needed: <BR>\r\n11 small jars - Permanent marker <BR>\r\nBarley, Sage, Garlic, Parsley, Rosemary, Ailanthus, Rose petals,<BR>\r\nSeaweed or any water plant, Silverweed, Weeping Willow, Moonwort<BR>\r\nIt doesn\'t matter if these herbs are dried, powdered or fresh.\r\n<BR>\r\nFirst take your eleven jars and label each one with the name of\r\na planet, including <BR>\r\nthe Earth, Moon and Sun. <BR>\r\nThen draw the symbols of each planet on the jars as well making\r\nsure your symbol matches the planet. <BR>\r\nNext fill each jar about half way with warm water. <BR>\r\nThen find the jar labeled Sun and add your rosemary; take your\r\nMercury jar and add parsley; <BR>\r\nTake your Venus jar and add the rose petals; take your Earth jar\r\nand add your barley; <BR>\r\nTake your Mars jar and add your garlic; take your Jupiter jar\r\nand add your sage; <BR>\r\nTake your Saturn jar and add your weeping willow; take your Uranus\r\njar and add your ailanthus; <BR>\r\nTake your Neptune jar and add your water plant and take your Pluto\r\njar and add the Silverweed <BR>\r\nand take your Moon jar and add your Moonwort.

When the jar is filled, <BR>\r\nor at least halfway so, cork it up with a red tapered candle.\r\nLight the candle and as it burns, <BR>\r\nit will drip wax to seal the bottle.

It\'s an electromagnetic\r\nfield that surrounds all living things. <BR>\r\nThey can be seen as well as felt, or sensed. <BR>\r\nAuras can reveal a persons emotional well being as well as physical\r\nstate. <BR>\r\nThere\'s no one method to seeing auras, the method given below\r\nis my personal way. <BR>\r\nFirst there\'s the background. <BR>\r\nSome sources say that when reading an aura it\'s best to have a\r\nvery dark black or red <BR>\r\nbackground, other\'s say to a white one. I\'ve tried both and found\r\nthat for me darker is much <BR>\r\neasier. Next, the aura is generally strongest around a person\'s\r\nhead, but it you don\'t have <BR>\r\nanother person to try this with, your own had will work fine.\r\n<BR>\r\nPick a point just beyond your hand and let your eye unfocused\r\n(it\'s very similar to the way you <BR>\r\nview a \'magic eye\' picture for those of you who know what that\r\nis).

Then, continue with\r\nyour left hand until you <BR>\r\nhave completed the suggestion ten times. <BR>\r\nThis may be your first attempt at learning to effectively program\r\nyourself through suggestion. <BR>\r\nIt is of the utmost importance to do this exercise every night\r\nwithout falling asleep until <BR>\r\nyou have completed ten repetitions. <BR>\r\nYou are beginning to establish a habit pattern of properly programming\r\nyourself by giving <BR>\r\nyourself positive suggestions before going to sleep. The next\r\nday, you will find yourself <BR>\r\nreacting very positively to that suggestion. <BR>\r\n                                     STEP TWO - INDUCTION<BR>\r\nContinue doing step one, the Pre-Sleep Technique you learned last\r\nweek. In addition, <BR>\r\nyou are to do the following: <BR>\r\nTwice a day - once in the morning or at noon, and once in the\r\nearly evening - you will <BR>\r\nhypnotize yourself, stay in hypnosis for two to three minutes,\r\nand then wake yourself up. Here\'s how : <BR>\r\n*Sit in a comfortable chair with your back supported. <BR>\r\n*Focus your attention - effortlessly - on a spot opposite you,\r\nslightly above eye level. <BR>\r\n*Take three deep breaths - slowly. As you inhale your third breath,\r\nhold it for three full <BR>\r\nseconds as you count backwards: three...two...one <BR>\r\n*Close your eyes, exhale, RELAX, and allow yourself to go into\r\na deep, sound, hypnotic rest. <BR>\r\nYou are to remain in hypnosis for approximately two - three minutes\r\nby counting down slowly <BR>\r\nfrom twenty - five to one.  (Note: It will help if you allow yourself\r\nto visualize or imagine each <BR>\r\nnumber being written on a blackboard or shown on a computer as\r\nyou count backward.) <BR>\r\nTo awaken, just count forward from one to three - and you will\r\nawaken refreshed and alert, <BR>\r\nready to go about your business in an energetic way.  Do this\r\nexercise twice a day for seven <BR>\r\ndays, after which you will be ready to give yourself beneficial\r\nsuggestions. <BR>\r\n                            STEP three - PROGRAMMED SUGGESTION<BR>\r\nThe third step in self-hypnosis is to be started one week after\r\nyou complete the exercises for <BR>\r\nstep 1 and step two. Once you start step three, you no longer\r\nhave to do step two. <BR>\r\nFor step three, you need a 3x5 card or a business card, which\r\nyou can easily carry with you at all times. <BR>\r\nYou are to write the suggestion you\'ve prepared for yourself which\r\nmeets the criteria of being <BR>\r\npositive, simple, believable, measurable - and it should carry\r\na reward. Always state your <BR>\r\nsuggestion in the present tense. <BR>\r\nAgain, sit down and chooses a spot opposite you, slightly above\r\neye level. Hold the card in <BR>\r\nfront of the spot and read the suggestion to yourself three times.\r\n<BR>\r\nMake sure the words on the card are believable to you and allow\r\nyourself to imagine accomplishing <BR>\r\nwhat is written on the card.  Use your imagination. <BR>\r\nYou have written your suggestion on a card - chosen your spot\r\n- read the suggestion to yourself three <BR>\r\ntimes - now, take your first deep breath. Exhale. Take your second\r\ndeep breath.

For example,\r\na bleeding knee first needs <BR>\r\nphysical attention.  Later, soothe the psychic. <BR>\r\nPerforming psychic first aid is simple. The following is based\r\non the idea that you will do this <BR>\r\nfor someone else; if you are working on yourself, follow the same\r\norder.   <BR>\r\nProtect yourself to make sure you are not influenced by the situation.\r\n<BR>\r\nDo this by wearing your initiation cords, centering, or meditating.\r\n<BR>\r\nSeal the area to protect others and to prevent outside influences\r\nfrom affecting the <BR>\r\nsituation further. If you cannot do a full circle, visualize the\r\narea in bright light. <BR>\r\nStabilize the person. Help them ground and center. Use a grounding\r\nstone if you have one <BR>\r\n(such as hematite). If a person is crying uncontrollably, let\r\nhim. Crying is cleansing. Just be <BR>\r\nthere and give him your (quiet) attention. If it\'s cool, get a\r\nblanket to help him stay warm. <BR>\r\nReview the situation. Now that everyone involved is centered and\r\nthe area is protected from <BR>\r\noutside influences, look at the situation. This is a good time\r\nto do divination work to determine <BR>\r\nthe root cause.<BR>\r\nRaise energy. This can be as simple as humming or briskly rubbing\r\nyour hands together. <BR>\r\nPerform a cut-away between the person and the outside influence.\r\n<BR>\r\nUse your Athame or visualize a bright light separating the person\r\nfrom the outside influence. <BR>\r\nIf the problem appears to be internal, use a drawing herb to bring\r\nthe influence out, and then <BR>\r\ndo a cut-away. If the problem started as a physical injury, do\r\na cut-away as a symbolic act to <BR>\r\nprevent the injury from happening again. <BR>\r\nSeal holes and balance the aura. My favorite is to have the person\r\nimagine a paint can filled <BR>\r\nwith all the colors of the rainbow. As this wonderful, warm paint\r\nspills out of the can, the aura <BR>\r\nabsorbs whatever color is needed. <BR>\r\nBanish any lingering influence. Rattles and bells are good banishers/sealers.\r\nThis step can <BR>\r\nbe combined with the previous step through smudging with an herbal\r\nsmoke, such as sage. <BR>\r\nPerform any other healing that\'s necessary. <BR>\r\nProtect the person from any returning influences. <BR>\r\nTeach him/her to set up her own shields and to clean his/her aura\r\n(sample below). <BR>\r\nSimple Aura Cleansing/Sealing <BR>\r\nBriskly rub your hands together until they start to tingle. If\r\nyou pull your hands apart slightly, <BR>\r\nyou will feel a pull bringing your hands back together. Starting\r\nat your crown, clean your aura <BR>\r\nwith a sweeping motion down and away from your body. You can lightly\r\ntouch your skin or <BR>\r\nhold your hands two to three inches away from your body. Do your\r\nhead, neck, chest, each <BR>\r\narm, and each leg and foot. Then do a sweeping motion from the\r\ntop of your head to the <BR>\r\nground, first on your front and then on your back.  Repeat as\r\nneeded.  Shake your hands <BR>\r\nout when finished.  The whole process takes about thirty seconds.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">CHAKRAS<BR>\r\nAccording to East Indian philosophy, we possess seven major *Chakras*\r\nor psychic centers on the body. <BR>\r\nEach of these forms a bridge, link, or energy transformer; changing\r\npure (higher) energy into various <BR>\r\nforms, and connecting the four bodies (i.e.. spiritual, mental,\r\nastral, and physical) together. <BR>\r\nThe chakras are located along the nadies (a network of psychic\r\nnerves or channels) and <BR>\r\nfollow the autonomic nervous system along the spinal cord. <BR>\r\nChakras correlate with major acupuncture points along the \'governing\r\nvessel meridian\' (acupuncture term). <BR>\r\nThe seven major chakras are connected together by three major\r\nnadies which are parallel and near each other. <BR>\r\nThe middle nadi is called *sushumna* and it has neutral characteristics.\r\n<BR>\r\nThe nadi on the left (i.e.. nearest your left hand) is the *ida*\r\nnadi which has yin characteristics. <BR>\r\nOn the other side of sushumna (nearest your right hand) is the\r\n*pingala* nadi, having yang qualities. <BR>\r\nChakras are visible to clairvoyant sight as varously colored rotating\r\ncircles or funnels. <BR>\r\nIn the East they are described as petaled flowers or lotuses.\r\n<BR>\r\nWhile in Western Shamanism they are devined as Spirit Tunnels.\r\n<BR>\r\nThere are many minor chakras throughout the body but in this writing\r\nwe will focus on the primary <BR>\r\nseven as the others are beyond the scope of this discussion.

It is a very bright shade of red and you can\r\nchant &quot;oohm&quot; in tone C while focusing on this area.\r\n<BR>\r\n*Sexual Chakra*<BR>\r\nLocated above and behind the genitals. Its dominant element is\r\nwater, and it is related to psychic <BR>\r\ntaste. It is a clear shade of orange. You can chant &quot;ohm&quot;\r\nin tone D for this one. <BR>\r\n*Solar Plexus*<BR>\r\nLocated at the navel and corresponding with the emotions and the\r\nelement of fire and also psychic <BR>\r\nsight (clairvoyance).

Usually the energy dissipates as\r\nsoon as we break the <BR>\r\nconcentration, but it is possible to purposely concentrate energy\r\nin this way, producing <BR>\r\nvery strong thoughtforms.   Such thoughtforms are vortexes or\r\ncenters of psychic energy. <BR>\r\nThey can exist as entities by themselves, at least for a while.\r\nThey are basically inanimate, <BR>\r\nnon-thinking forces. Talking to one is about as logical as talking\r\nto a chair. <BR>\r\nIn this way, thoughtforms are similar to elementals, ghosts, and\r\nspirits. <BR>\r\nAll of these psychic entities consist of a psychic energy vortex\r\nwhich could be described <BR>\r\nas a localized field or as a discontinuity of the physical world.\r\n<BR>\r\nPsychic entities respond to certain electrostatic and magnetic\r\nfields, and to other energy vortexes. <BR>\r\nThat is why they respond to Magick ritual. <BR>\r\nPsychic entities are sometimes able to affect our thought processes.\r\n <BR>\r\nThoughtforms and elementals, are usually not very smart. <BR>\r\nIf they display any intelligence at all, it is limited. They are\r\nthe morons of the spirit world. <BR>\r\nTheir behavior is usually automatic, repetitive, robot-like (just\r\nlike some people). <BR>\r\nWe see that artificial elementals are little more than astral\r\nrobots. <BR>\r\nSpirits and deities are more intelligent and volitional.  <BR>\r\nDirected Attention <BR>\r\nYour mind follows your attention. <BR>\r\nWherever you direct your attention, there will your thoughts go\r\ntoo. <BR>\r\nBy directing attention to a specific place or purpose you focus\r\nmental energy upon it. <BR>\r\nFor example: you\'re having lunch in a cafeteria crowded with people.\r\n<BR>\r\nIt is a large place, and everyone there is talking at once, so\r\nthat the room is a constant jumble of noise. <BR>\r\nYou happen to notice a man across the room; he reminds you of\r\nsomeone. <BR>\r\nAll at once he drops his fork and you hear it hit the table. <BR>\r\nBut would you have noticed the sound of his fork if you had not\r\nbeen looking? <BR>\r\nNo.  Only by focusing your attention there were you able to pick\r\nout that individual event <BR>\r\nand associated sound.  It is a dark night.  You are walking and\r\nthe only light you have is <BR>\r\nfrom the flashlight you hold in your hand.  As you move the flashlight\r\naround, the beam <BR>\r\nof light from it directs your attention first one way then another.\r\nNow, the mind is <BR>\r\nsomething like that flashlight in the dark.  <BR>\r\nAnd by directed attention, you point the mind to one place or\r\nanother. <BR>\r\nAs with that flashlight beam, you see where the mind is pointed;\r\nnothing more. <BR>\r\nThe rest is \'noise\'. And so we could define mental noise as anything\r\nnot focused upon. <BR>\r\nIn another way, noise could be considered as negative emotions,\r\nattitudes, and thoughts <BR>\r\nwhich make it more difficult to direct the attention. <BR>\r\n Your emotions follow your thoughts quite easily. Your emotions\r\nare not you, but are rather <BR>\r\nreactions prompted by your model and ego -- like a performance\r\nor an act, while the real <BR>\r\nyou watches. In a similar way, directing your attention toward\r\na specific emotion will <BR>\r\ncause you to experience that emotion.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">SPELL TO COMMUNICATE WITH SOMEONE<BR>\r\nLight a blue candle. <BR>\r\nWrite a personal, positive, and meaningful letter to someone you\r\ndesire to contact. <BR>\r\nBurn the letter in the candle flame.

One body could <BR>\r\nsometimes be shared by several kupua, and a single kupua might\r\nhave several bodies of each type. <BR>\r\nPurpose <BR>\r\nThe aim of this working is to transfer perception to another body\r\n- in this case, the cloud body. <BR>\r\nIt can be thought of as an &quot;out of one body and into another&quot;\r\nexperience. <BR>\r\nMaterials Needed:   An open space, dry ice, passivity <BR>\r\nThe Rite <BR>\r\nOpen by whatever means feels appropriate. <BR>\r\nSet the dry ice in the center of the working area. <BR>\r\nParticipants circle deosil around the ice, chanting <BR>\r\n&quot;Ka-ao-opua-loa&quot; (the sharp-pointed living cloud). In\r\nthe Hawaiian legends, this was <BR>\r\n  the name of the kupua of the cloud people. <BR>\r\nCircling and chanting continue for 10-15 minutes, at the end of\r\n<BR>\r\nwhich all sit down in a circle as close to the ice as possible.\r\n<BR>\r\nAll stare into the fog rising from the ice until tunnel vision\r\n<BR>\r\nsets in (the field of vision goes black except for the object\r\nfocused upon). <BR>\r\nAt the moment that tunnel vision occurs, say: <BR>\r\n  BER WOCEP WHEBONG<BR>\r\n  As below, so above <BR>\r\n  NEKOZY ONGO TENFEMET SOCAGI<BR>\r\n  The cloud is in my eye <BR>\r\n  KA-AO-OPUA LOA HATUNN DOUCK<BR>\r\n  Ka-ao-opua-loa carry my sight<BR>\r\nParticipants begin spinning at increasing speed with eyes closed,\r\nall the while repeating <BR>\r\n  TENFEMET DOUCK<BR>\r\n When spinning is no longer possible, participants lie on their\r\n<BR>\r\nbacks and open the eyes completely (no squinting) and focus on\r\nthe first cloud they see. <BR>\r\nAll repeat: <BR>\r\n  BER WHEBONG WOCEP<BR>\r\n  as above, so below <BR>\r\n  NEKOZY ONGO TENFEMET TRESLIX<BR>\r\n  my eye is in the cloud <BR>\r\n  XIQUAL TENFEMET-NEKOZY<BR>\r\n  phenomenize the cloud-eye<BR>\r\nVisualize a fog exactly like that rising from the dry ice leaving\r\nthe eyes and rushing up <BR>\r\nto join with the clouds. Observe it entirely passively, and with\r\nthe inner voice repeat <BR>\r\n&quot;This self is Tenfemet-Douck, the cloud that sees.&quot;\r\n<BR>\r\nWhen tunnel vision again sets in, close the eyes and open them\r\nagain quickly. <BR>\r\nLook down over the terrain that passes below your cloud-eye. Note\r\ndetails if desired, <BR>\r\nbut do not attempt to influence direction or speed of motion.\r\n<BR>\r\nAll control of these should be left to the wind. <BR>\r\nWhen you have achieved your desired results, switch out of the\r\npassive mode <BR>\r\nand attempt to influence direction or speed. <BR>\r\nFind yourself back in your human body looking up at the clouds.\r\n<BR>\r\nBanish by laughter, and with other means if desired.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">ASTRAL PROJECTION<BR>\r\nThis technique is superior to others because it does not require\r\nintense visualization, <BR>\r\nwhich many people cannot do. One of the chief barriers people\r\nlearning to project <BR>\r\nface is fear. Many are afraid that they may die, or be harmed\r\nin some way as a result <BR>\r\nof their projection. Nothing could be farther from the truth.\r\n<BR>\r\nStep one: <BR>\r\nRelax the body. the ability to relax is the first prerequisite,\r\nperhaps even the first <BR>\r\nstep itself to having an OBE.  This includes both physical and\r\nmental relaxation.  <BR>\r\nDo not suggest a method of attaining this relaxation, although\r\nProgressive Muscle<BR>\r\nrelaxation, coupled with deep breathing exercises (inhale 1, exhale\r\n2, inhale 3.... <BR>\r\nuntil 50 or 100) are known to work well. <BR>\r\nStep two: <BR>\r\nEnter the state bordering sleep. This is known as the hypnagogic\r\nstate. <BR>\r\nOnce again, do recommend any method of doing this.  One way is\r\nto hold your forearm up, <BR>\r\nwhile keeping your upper arm on the bed, or ground.  As you start\r\nto fall asleep, your arm will <BR>\r\nfall, and you will awaken again.  With practice, you can learn\r\nto control the Hypnagogic state <BR>\r\nwithout using your arm.  Another method is to concentrate on an\r\nobject. When other images <BR>\r\nstart to enter your thoughts, you have entered the Hypnagogic\r\nstate. <BR>\r\nPassively watch these images. This will also help you maintain\r\nthis state of near-sleep. <BR>\r\nStep three: <BR>\r\nDeepen this state. Begin to clear your mind. observe your field\r\nof vision through your <BR>\r\nclosed eyes. Do nothing more for a while. Simply look through\r\nyour closed eyelids at the blackness <BR>\r\nin front of you. After a while, you may notice light patterns.\r\nThese are simply neural discharges. <BR>\r\nThey have no specific effect. Ignore them. When they cease, one\r\nCondition B. From here, one <BR>\r\nmust enter an even deeper state of relaxation which calls Condition\r\nC-- a state of such relaxation <BR>\r\nthat you lose all awareness of the body and sensory stimulation.\r\nYou are almost in a void in which <BR>\r\nyour only source of stimulation will be your own thoughts. The\r\nideal state for leaving your body is <BR>\r\nCondition D. This is Condition C when it is voluntarily induced\r\nfrom a rested and refreshed condition <BR>\r\nand is not the effect of normal fatigue. To achieve Condition\r\nD, suggest that you practice entering <BR>\r\nit in the morning or after a short nap. <BR>\r\nStep Four: <BR>\r\nEnter a state of Vibration. This is the most important part of\r\nthe technique, and also the <BR>\r\nmost vague. Many projectors have noted these vibrations at the\r\nonset of projection. <BR>\r\nThey can be experienced as a mild tingling, or as is electricity\r\nis being shot through the body. <BR>\r\nThe cause is a mystery.  It may actually be the astral body trying\r\nto leave the physical one. <BR>\r\nFor entering into the vibrational state,  offer the following\r\ndirections: <BR>\r\nRemove all jewelry or other items that might be touching your\r\nskin. <BR>\r\nDarken the room so that no light can be seen through your eyelids,\r\nbut do not shut out all light. <BR>\r\nLie down with your body along a north-south axis, with your head\r\npointed toward magnetic north. <BR>\r\nLoosen all clothing, but keep covered so that you are slightly\r\nwarmer than might normally be comfortable. <BR>\r\nBe sure you are in a location where, and at a time when, there\r\nwill be absolutely no noise to disturb you. <BR>\r\nEnter a state of relaxation.<BR>\r\nGive yourself the mental suggestion that you will remember all\r\nthat occurs during the <BR>\r\nupcoming session that will be beneficial to your well-being. \r\nRepeat this five times. <BR>\r\nProceed to breath through your half-open mouth. <BR>\r\nAs you breath, concentrate on the void in front of you. <BR>\r\nSelect a point a foot away from your forehead, then change your\r\npoint of mental reference to six feet. <BR>\r\nTurn the point 90 degrees upward by drawing an imaginary line\r\nparallel to your body axis up and <BR>\r\nabove your head. Focus there and reach out for the vibrations\r\nat that point and bring them back <BR>\r\ninto your body. Even if you don\'t know what these vibrations are,\r\nyou will know when you have <BR>\r\nachieved contact with them. <BR>\r\nStep five: <BR>\r\nLearn to control the vibrational state. Practice controlling them\r\nby mentally pushing them <BR>\r\ninto your head, down to your toes, making them surge throughout\r\nyour entire body, and <BR>\r\nproducing vibrational waves from head to foot. To produce this\r\nwave effect, concentrate <BR>\r\nof the vibrations and mentally push a wave out of your head and\r\nguide it down your body. <BR>\r\nPractice this until you can induce these waves on command. <BR>\r\nOnce you have control of the vibrational state, you are ready\r\nto leave the body. <BR>\r\nStep six: <BR>\r\nBegin with a partial separation. The key here is thought control.\r\nKeep your mind firmly focused <BR>\r\non the idea of leaving the body. Do not let it wander. Stray thought\r\nmight cause you to lose <BR>\r\ncontrol of the state. Now, having entered the vibrational state,\r\nbegin exploring the OBE by <BR>\r\nreleasing a hand or a foot of the &quot;second body&quot;.  suggest\r\nthat you extend a limb until it comes <BR>\r\nin contact with a familiar object, such as a wall near your bed.\r\nThen push it through the object. <BR>\r\nReturn the limb by placing it back into coincidence with the physical\r\none, decrease the vibrational <BR>\r\nrate, and then terminate the experiment. Lie quietly until you\r\nhave fully returned to normal. <BR>\r\nThis exercise will prepare you for full separation. <BR>\r\nStep seven: <BR>\r\nDissociate yourself from the body. Monroe suggests two methods\r\nfor this. <BR>\r\nOne method is to lift out of the body. To do this, think about\r\ngetting lighter and lighter after <BR>\r\nentering this vibrational state. Think about how nice it would\r\nbe to float upward. <BR>\r\nKeep this thought in mind at all costs and let no extraneous thoughts\r\ninterrupt it. <BR>\r\nAn OBE will occur naturally at this point. <BR>\r\nAnother method is the &quot;Rotation method&quot; or &quot;roll-out&quot;\r\ntechnique. <BR>\r\nWhen you have achieved the vibrational state, try to roll over\r\nas if you were turning over in bed. <BR>\r\nDo not attempt to roll over physically. Try to twist your body\r\nfrom the top and virtually roll over into <BR>\r\nyour second body right out of your physical self. At this point,\r\nyou will be out of the body but next to it. <BR>\r\nThink of floating upward, and you should find yourself floating\r\nabove the body.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">THE FOUR PLANES<BR>\r\nTo get successful results from magic, work must be done upon all\r\nfour of the planes. <BR>\r\nIn ascending order, these are the physical plane, the emotional\r\nplane, the mental plane, <BR>\r\nand the spiritual plane. <BR>\r\nThe PHYSICAL PLANE:<BR>\r\nSuggest working with a structure which is similar to a four-story\r\nhouse when practicing magic. <BR>\r\nShe says to imagine that the ground floor represents the physical\r\nplane. This floor contains <BR>\r\na number of rooms, each representing a particular magical technique\r\nappropriate to this plane. <BR>\r\nThis is a room where oils are blended and poured, a room where\r\ncandles are molded and <BR>\r\nconsecrated, a room where waters are created, a room where powders\r\nand incense are <BR>\r\ncompounded, and a room where crystals are cleansed and charged\r\nwith energy. Each of <BR>\r\nthese rooms is dedicated to a particular element, so that as you\r\nwork with these physical <BR>\r\ntools you learn about the four elements and their correspondence\r\nto the various facets <BR>\r\nwithin your character. <BR>\r\nThere is a kitchen with a large hearth; this is your lab. And\r\nthere is an herb garden just <BR>\r\noutside the kitchen. There is also a storage room which contains\r\nsupplies of magical tools. <BR>\r\nAs a novice, you will, of necessity, spend more time obtaining\r\nsupplies for magical practice <BR>\r\nthan in creating the supplies themselves. Later, when you are\r\nmore experienced, you may <BR>\r\ndecide to specialize in the creation of one or more magical tools.\r\nFinally, there is a small room <BR>\r\nwhich serves as a temple where, after all your preparations, you\r\nmay practice your Magick.<BR>\r\nThere are 2 important reasons to practice magic on the physical\r\nlevel. <BR>\r\nFirst: physical materials such as herbs and incense stimulate\r\nyour senses, which in turn <BR>\r\nactivate certain areas of your psyche and create an emotional\r\nstate in you conducive to <BR>\r\nthe practice of magic. Second: the use of physical materials grounds\r\nenergies generated <BR>\r\non the higher planes so that you obtain tangible results from\r\nyour magical operations.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">The EMOTIONAL PLANE<BR>\r\nAccording to Nancy Watson, this is the second floor of the house.\r\nIt also contains several rooms. <BR>\r\nThere is a quiet room where you can daydream and visualize what\r\nit is you want to achieve. <BR>\r\nThere are studios where you can experiment with music, dance,\r\nor the visual arts to see what <BR>\r\neffect these have upon your emotional state. And there are a variety\r\nof therapy rooms available <BR>\r\nso that you may release the emotional stresses which are the primary\r\ncause of physical illness and pain.<BR>\r\nThe emotional plane plays a pivotal role in magic.

There\r\nis a beautiful brazier, containing <BR>\r\nthe fire of purification and creativity. The roof opens, like\r\nthe dome of an observatory, on clear <BR>\r\nstarry nights. A spiral ladder climbs to the open sky so that\r\nyou may without hindrance observe <BR>\r\nthe starts, offer prayers, and receive the influx of divine inspiration.\r\nIt is a generally quiet plane, <BR>\r\nexcept for those times when chants and music are heard.<BR>\r\nthe work you do on the spiritual level affects all lower levels,\r\nand gives depth and permanence <BR>\r\nto your magickal operations.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">These four planes comprise the formal architecture\r\nof magic. </FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">CELLAR. The cellar is a dark and labyrinthine\r\nplace. It contains all your instincts and personal <BR>\r\nmemories. It also contains those feelings, thoughts, and urges\r\nyou choose to deny or ignore. <BR>\r\nYour sanity and the quality and quantity of your energy depend\r\non this, for what goes on in the <BR>\r\ncellar will eventually affect, for good or ill, the emotional\r\nplane. The cellar is otherwise known as <BR>\r\nyour personal unconscious.  if you wish to practice magic safely,\r\nyou must have a deep knowledge <BR>\r\nof what is going on in your personal unconscious.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">ASTRAL TRAVEL<BR>\r\nTo use modern scientific terminology, as astral journey requires\r\nthat <BR>\r\nyou acieve an altered state of consciousness (ASC) so that you\r\ncan <BR>\r\ngo &quot;out-of-body&quot; to the realm you wish to visit. Saying\r\nthe same <BR>\r\nthing in old-fashioned esoterie terms, it requires that you go\r\ninto <BR>\r\ntrance and use astral projection to reach the desired realm. Stated\r\n<BR>\r\nin plain English,you must first physically relax to the extent\r\nthat <BR>\r\nyou become unaware of your body, and then imagine yourself in\r\nthe <BR>\r\nrealm you wish to visit. It\'s really quite simple.<BR>\r\n     The technique\'s simplicity, however, should not lull you\r\ninto a <BR>\r\nfalse sense of security. There are more things between heaven\r\nand <BR>\r\nEarth than are dreamt of in you philosophy,and if you wish to\r\nexplore <BR>\r\nthe areas which lie between the spiritual and physical planes,\r\nyou <BR>\r\nmust be prepared to meet these &quot;things.&quot; The astral\r\nplane is <BR>\r\ninhabitied by a great variety of creatures, some of which--on\r\nthe <BR>\r\nlower levels, anyway--aren\'t particularly pleasant. Some of these\r\nare <BR>\r\npeculiar to the individual, while others are picked up from society\r\nat large.<BR>\r\n     The unconscious mind takes your darker feelings and thoughts\r\nand <BR>\r\nmolds them into those forms, personal or collective,which will\r\nmost <BR>\r\nfrighten you so that you will heed its warnings. Individuals who\r\nface <BR>\r\ntheir inner demons head-on, usually through the psychotherapeutic\r\n<BR>\r\nprocess, don\'t have to fear confronting them while exploring ASCs,\r\n<BR>\r\nbecause the mere act of acknoledging them effectively exorcises\r\nthem. <BR>\r\nBut for those who have not squarely faced the ugly or dangerous\r\n<BR>\r\naspects of their characters, it is quite a different story.<BR>\r\n     Psychological considerations aside, classical esoteric theory\r\n<BR>\r\nmaintains that the universe contains some energies--beings, creatures\r\n<BR>\r\nor whatever one wishes to call them--that are not altogether friendly\r\n<BR>\r\nto humankind which, if suddenly or unexpectedly confronted, could\r\n<BR>\r\ncause a good deal of trauma for any magician operating at levels\r\n<BR>\r\nother than normal consciousness.<BR>\r\n     My purpose in discussing possible dangers relating to astral\r\n<BR>\r\ntravel is not to frighten you to the extent that you don\'t attempt\r\n<BR>\r\nit, but rather to warn you that safety measures are required for\r\nthis <BR>\r\nkind of work--even for those who are experienced and knowledgeable\r\n<BR>\r\nabout the Shadow side of their characters. My own psychotherapy\r\nhas <BR>\r\nexposed to view most of my inner demons, but even so I would never\r\n<BR>\r\nconsider going out-of-body without adequate protective measures.<BR>\r\n     Never indulge in drugs or alcohol prior to astral travel.\r\nTo do <BR>\r\nso is to court disaster. As Dion Fortune said:</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">          To open the psychic centres and contact\r\nother planes<BR>\r\n          does not constitute the whole of psychism. \'It is <BR>\r\n          necessary to know how to approach and handle that which<BR>\r\n          is contacted. Drugs do not confer this knowledge, which\r\n<BR>\r\n          only comes with experience\'....Moreover, a dangerous\r\n<BR>\r\n          astral contact may be formed at the very first<BR>\r\n          experiment. (Note from Molli- Ms. Fortune states that\r\nsome <BR>\r\n          on the Left-Hand Path may use drugs for raising con-<BR>\r\n          sciousness, i.e. black magician, so if you are not on\r\n<BR>\r\n          that path, they are stating to avoid this)</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">It is imperative that you perform the personal\r\nand god symbols <BR>\r\nexercises recommended by Murry Hope. (will be given at end)before\r\nyou <BR>\r\nattempt this journey, or any other form of astral travel. These\r\n<BR>\r\nsymbols will act as your passport and personal security guard\r\nwhile <BR>\r\nyou explore altered states of consciousness.<BR>\r\n     Shamanic journesy with earthly destinations require that\r\nyou <BR>\r\nmove downward, at least for a time, before you reach the disired\r\n<BR>\r\nrealm. Astral journeys with cosmic destinations--those which require\r\n<BR>\r\nyou to leave the planet and move into space--demand that you move\r\n<BR>\r\nupward before reaching you destination. Keeping these principles\r\nin <BR>\r\nmind, you can easily design you own astral travels.<BR>\r\n     Journeying requires a good deal of physical and mental <BR>\r\ndiscipline. When leading groups of people on shamanic journeys,\r\nit\'s <BR>\r\nbeen my observation that some individuals have difficulty remaining\r\n<BR>\r\nphysically still. This usually reflects a parallel mental unrest.\r\nThe <BR>\r\ninability to acieve physical or mental stillness represents a\r\nserious <BR>\r\nobstacle in the path of the aspiring magician. One of the best\r\nways <BR>\r\nto overcome the problem is through the practice of Hatha and Raja\r\n<BR>\r\nYoga. Hatha Yoga teaches bodily discipline, and Raja teaches <BR>\r\nmeditation (mental stillness). My own Hatha Yoga teacher included\r\n<BR>\r\nmeditation along with physical instruction; it\'s my understanding\r\n<BR>\r\nthat this is normal procedure.<BR>\r\n     Astral travel plays a large part in the advanced magician\'s\r\n<BR>\r\nrepertoire, and with good reason. It enables them to acquaint\r\n<BR>\r\nthemselves with beings who can help them with their projects.\r\nThere <BR>\r\nare reasons for journeying beyond the purely practical, however.\r\n<BR>\r\nKnowledge may be gained from beings who belong to other dimensions--<BR>\r\nand in magic (as in life), knowledge is power.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">RID ONE\'S SELF OF PSYCHIC VAMPIRES<BR>\r\nWe all hate those evil beings who steal our good work, our dreams,\r\nand lovers, <BR>\r\nthis spell is also good to erase old memories that tend to haunt\r\nus through out our life. <BR>\r\nWhat you will need: <BR>\r\nTwo white candles representing the God (right side of altar) \r\nand a Goddess (left side of altar) <BR>\r\nYour favorite smelling incense. <BR>\r\nSEA SALT!!

Most martial art use power moves to\r\none degree or another. <BR>\r\nWhen people dance from their hearts, they are doing power moves,\r\nallowing the power to speak <BR>\r\nthrough their bodies. Power moves are a dance of power. Tai Chi\r\nis an ancient example of power moves.<BR>\r\n     Whenever you handle energy, you receive it with your left\r\nhand and send it with your right hand. <BR>\r\nYour left hand acts as an antenna and your right hand broadcasts\r\nthe energy you have received. <BR>\r\nIf you are open to its direction, power will instruct you-it will\r\n&quot;tell&quot; you what to do. <BR>\r\nFlowing with that energy can be a powerful and centering experience.\r\n<BR>\r\nIt can also be distressing when you fight it or cannot control\r\nit.<BR>\r\n     This dance of power begins as you relax and become mentally\r\ncentered. <BR>\r\nStand quietly with your legs shoulder-width apart. <BR>\r\nMentally give the power permission to flow through you and ask\r\nit to guide you. <BR>\r\nRaise your hands and hold them in front of you. <BR>\r\nLet your hands and body move as you feel guided. <BR>\r\nYour movements will be smooth and rhythmic, almost like a ballet.<BR>\r\nPower moves are a form of moving meditation. They are relaxing\r\nand energizing. <BR>\r\nAs you do them, you collect a great deal of power in your body.\r\n<BR>\r\nThey are healing to both mind and body. If it feels appropriate,\r\nyou can play gentle <BR>\r\nmusic or light a candle. Relax and let the energy move your body.\r\n<BR>\r\nNotice how it feels as it flows through you. <BR>\r\nAfter you have relaxed into the energy, allow it to move you for\r\nabout fifteen minutes and <BR>\r\nthen stop. Gently sit down and close your eyes. Ask the universe\r\nhow to use the energy <BR>\r\nyou have collected. If you don\'t get a specific answer, send the\r\nenergy to Mother Earth <BR>\r\nso it can heal the planet, yourself, and the people you love.\r\nAllow yourself to bathe in the <BR>\r\njoy of that energy.  If you are having a difficult time feeling\r\nthe guidance of the energy, <BR>\r\nstart with your hands. Hold them in front of your face and move\r\nyour right hand clockwise <BR>\r\nand your left hand counter- clockwise. Move them slowly and rhythmically\r\nin and out. <BR>\r\nGently notice how it feels. Then while you are sitting in a chair,\r\nbegin moving your legs <BR>\r\nin a circular motion, noticing how it feels.  After you are comfortable\r\nwith those movements, <BR>\r\nstand up and again begin with your hands. First move one hand\r\nout and away from you and <BR>\r\nthen step rhythmically out with one of your legs. Next do the\r\nsame with the other hand and leg. <BR>\r\nSlowly begin moving around the room. Notice your body and let\r\nyourself enjoy its movements. <BR>\r\nAllow the process to be sensual and rhythmic. Be gentle with yourself\r\nas you practice allowing <BR>\r\nyour awareness to expand. Enjoy the process.<BR>\r\nEXERCISES:<BR>\r\n1. Practice finding power spots wherever you go.<BR>\r\n2. Find your special power spot. We all have places on this earth\r\nthat are sacred to us. <BR>\r\nTake time to find your sacred place. Once you find it, spend some\r\ntime there. <BR>\r\nLet that place heal you and fill you with its love. Let your heart\r\nguide you to that place. <BR>\r\nIt will call to you if you are willing to listen.<BR>\r\n3. Buy a packet of seeds and divide it in half. Do some power\r\nmoves and then sit quietly <BR>\r\nwith half of the seeds. Allow yourself to feel their life energy\r\nand then slowly begin <BR>\r\nchanneling energy to them. Mentally see them growing big and strong.\r\nPlant each <BR>\r\ngroup of seeds in separate pots and give them equal care.   Notice\r\nhow much healthier the energized group is.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">9/9/01<BR>\r\n</FONT>\r\n\r\n</BODY>',

One effective method\r\nof implementing this is utilizing<BR>\r\ncandle magic. A reverse candle is one that reverses whatever the\r\nindividual who is attempting<BR>\r\nto harm may be doing. If there is a specific individual in mind\r\n(an ex-spouse, an ex-lover, an<BR>\r\nex-employer, etc.) then write his/her name on the candle (red\r\non top half, black on bottom half)<BR>\r\nusing permanent markers or some other indelible method.

It is critical to think positively during the\r\nprocess. Negativity will bog the<BR>\r\nprocess down. Upon your return home create a positive spell outlining\r\nwhat you want the<BR>\r\nsituation to be -- use a white candle or one that represents the\r\npositive to you.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">HOW TO BREAK A JINX OR GET UNCROSSED<BR>\r\nIf you have been crossed or jinxed, or someone has put roots on\r\nyou, you may not know<BR>\r\nwho did it, but you may suspect and even be able to remember how\r\nit was done.<BR>\r\nOne common way to cross someone is to sprinkle Crossing Powder,\r\nHot Foot Powder,<BR>\r\nor Goofer Dust across their trackway or doorstep, or dress their\r\nsocks or shoes.<BR>\r\nI have even heard of women who will dress their own privates so\r\nthat a man will<BR>\r\ndrag himself in it and lose his nature or jinx up his love life.<BR>\r\nAnother way to fix a person is to get something personal of theirs\r\nand stop it up in a bottle<BR>\r\nwith roots and nails, pins, or needles. Your hair may have been\r\ngotten this way, or a piece<BR>\r\nof your clothing, or your personal concerns. This trick may have\r\nbeen done to you by an<BR>\r\nenemy to control you, dominate you, or get revenge on you by destroying\r\nyour happiness<BR>\r\nin love and money matters.<BR>\r\nFirst, if you have been having bad luck for a long time or are\r\nsuffering from an unnatural illness<BR>\r\nbut you have no known enemy and no one has ever openly declared\r\nthemselves against you,<BR>\r\ncheck around your home and see if you can find something that\r\nanyone could have secretly<BR>\r\nput there to jinx you, like burying something in your front yard.\r\nIf you find something, like a bottle<BR>\r\nwith personal effects, roots, or hairs in it, dig it up and burn\r\nit or throw it away in running water.<BR>\r\nIf you can\'t find such a thing, you may have been fixed with some\r\nmess sprinkled on your food<BR>\r\nor on your shoes.<BR>\r\nYou need to get 2 white offertory candles for uncrossing and some\r\nUncrossing oil to dress them.<BR>\r\nAlso, and this is important, before lighting the candles, I want\r\nyou to take a bath in some purifying<BR>\r\nherbs or Uncrossing type bath preparation. The hyssop herb bath\r\nis something you can make<BR>\r\nup yourself from hyssop leaves or you can buy ready-made Uncrossing\r\nBath Crystals with Hyssop,<BR>\r\nor -- for a really strong job -- you can use the 13 Herb Spiritual\r\nBath, which contains hyssop and<BR>\r\n12 other uncrossing herbs.<BR>\r\nMany folks use 13 packets of 13 Herb Spiritual Bath and take a\r\nbath every morning for a total<BR>\r\nof 13 days to clear away a really bad jinx. Hyssop is what is\r\nrecommended in the Bible for<BR>\r\npurification. (Look up the 51st Psalm; this is the one that tells\r\nyou how to use the hyssop<BR>\r\nbath. If you are not a Christian, you can still use the hyssop\r\nherb; it is traditional for<BR>\r\nuncrossing in any case.)<BR>\r\nTo prepare the bath, you either brew up the herbs into a tea and\r\nstrain it or dissolve the<BR>\r\nmineral crystals in warm water. Then you recite the 51st Psalm\r\n(or an uncrossing spell of<BR>\r\nyour choice) as you pour the bath water over your head. If you\r\nare taking the 13 Herb<BR>\r\nBath, you pour the water and recite the 51st Psalm 13 times for\r\neach morning\'s bath.<BR>\r\nWhen you have finished the bath, step out of the tub and light\r\nthe 2 white candles that<BR>\r\nhave been dressed with Uncrossing Oil. Stand between the candles.\r\nDo not dry yourself<BR>\r\nwith a towel -- let the bath water dry on you in the air as the\r\ncandles burn.<BR>\r\nNow recite the 37th Psalm, the one folks call &quot;The Uncrossing\r\npsalm.&quot;<BR>\r\nThis is the one that begins &quot;Fret not thyself with evil-doers...&quot;<BR>\r\nPinch out the candles (don\'t blow them out) if you intend to work\r\nthis spell for the<BR>\r\nfull 13 days. If you do will only be doing it for one day, just\r\nlet the candles burn until<BR>\r\nthey go out, no matter how long that takes.<BR>\r\nIf you are not a Christian, then instead of the 37th Psalm, just\r\nvoice your request in your<BR>\r\nown words that the jinx be lifted and the one who put it on you\r\nbe struck down.<BR>\r\nAfter taking this bath, some people then use the remaining bath\r\nwater to wash down their<BR>\r\nfloors and especially the doorstep of the house. Mix the bath\r\nwater into a bucket with some<BR>\r\nChinese Wash or Van Van Oil to make it stronger. Wash from the\r\nback of the premises to the<BR>\r\nfront. Sweep out the front doorway area while the floor is still\r\nwet. Once you are done with the<BR>\r\nwash water, carry whatever remains out of the house and pour it\r\non the ground outside<BR>\r\n(not down the drain).<BR>\r\nDo this every morning upon awakening -- bathing, praying, lighting\r\nthe white candles, and<BR>\r\nwashing down the house -- for 13 days and this will bring you\r\nrelief from crossed conditions.<BR>\r\nIf you know who has put this crossed condition on you and you\r\nwant to reverse the spell<BR>\r\nonto them, burn a black candle on their name (putting their name\r\non a paper beneath an<BR>\r\noverturned saucer under the candle) or carve their name on the\r\ncandle. If you use a black<BR>\r\ncandle in the figure of the Devil and carve their name on it,\r\ndress it with Cast Off Evil Oil and<BR>\r\nthings will go harder with them. If you don\'t know the name of\r\nthe person who did this trick to<BR>\r\nyou, carve the words &quot;My Enemy&quot; on the candle. Burn\r\nthe black candle on the toilet tank, a<BR>\r\nlittle bit each night, pinching it out between burnings. Burn\r\nit while the moon is growing smaller --<BR>\r\nand on the dark of the moon, the darkest night of the month, turn\r\nthe burning black candle<BR>\r\nupside down and extinguish it in the toilet bowl, saying<BR>\r\n&quot;Thus will you, [name of enemy], meet your fate!&quot;<BR>\r\nThrow the remaining black candle stub and wax into a crossroads\r\n-- or into the yard of the<BR>\r\nperson who had put the roots on you or jinxed you.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">SPELLTO REVERSE NEGATIVITY OR HEXES<BR>\r\nTry this spell to reverse any negativity or hexes being sent your\r\nway.<BR>\r\nVisualize all blocks in your life-path being removed.<BR>\r\nAnoint a purple candle with Rosemary oil.<BR>\r\nOn a piece of white paper write the following in black ink:<BR>\r\nAll blocks are now removed.<BR>\r\nFold the paper three times.

You may not<BR>\r\nknow who did it...but you may suspect and even be able to remember\r\nhow it was done.<BR>\r\nOne common way to cross someone is to sprinkle Crossing Powder,\r\nHot Foot Powder, or<BR>\r\nGoofer Dust across their trackway or doorstep, or dress their\r\nsocks or shoes.<BR>\r\nAnother way to fix a person is to get something personal of theirs\r\nand stop it up in a bottle<BR>\r\nwith roots and nails, pins, or needles. Your hair may have been\r\ngotten this way, or a piece<BR>\r\nof your clothing, or your personal concerns. This trick may have\r\nbeen done to you by an<BR>\r\nenemy to control you, dominate you, or get revenge on you by destroying\r\nyour happiness<BR>\r\nin love and money matters.<BR>\r\nIf you want to undo this sort of work, it helps to know who put\r\nthe jinx on you so you can<BR>\r\ncall their name back at them, but even if you don\'t know who did\r\nit or how it was done,<BR>\r\nthere are things you can do to take off the jinx.<BR>\r\nCheck around your home and see if you can find something that\r\nanyone could have<BR>\r\nsecretly put there to jinx you, like burying something in your\r\nfront yard. If you find<BR>\r\nsomething, like a bottle with personal effects, roots, or hairs\r\nin it, dig it up and burn it<BR>\r\nor throw it away in running water. Even if you can\'t find such\r\na thing, you may have<BR>\r\nbeen fixed with some mess sprinkled on your food or on your shoes.<BR>\r\nYou need to get 2 white offertory candles for uncrossing and some\r\nUncrossing oil to dress them.<BR>\r\nAlso, and this is important, before lighting the candles, take\r\na bath in some purifying<BR>\r\nherbs or Uncrossing type bath preparation. The hyssop herb bath\r\nis something you<BR>\r\ncan make up yourself from hyssop leaves or you can buy ready-made\r\nUncrossing<BR>\r\nBath Crystals with Hyssop, or -- for a really strong job -- you\r\ncan use the 13 Herb<BR>\r\nSpiritual Bath, which contains hyssop and 12 other uncrossing\r\nherbs.<BR>\r\nUse 13 packets of 13 Herb Spiritual Bath and take a bath every\r\nmorning for a<BR>\r\ntotal of 13 days to clear away a really bad jinx. Hyssop is what\r\nis recommended<BR>\r\nfor purification. Call upon the deity of your choice.<BR>\r\nTo prepare the bath, you either brew up the herbs into a tea and\r\nstrain it or dissolve<BR>\r\nthe mineral crystals in warm water. Then you recite an uncrossing\r\nspell of your choice<BR>\r\nas you pour the bath water over your head. If you are taking the\r\n13 Herb Bath, you<BR>\r\npour the water and recite your prayer13 times for each morning\'s\r\nbath.<BR>\r\nWhen you have finished the bath, step out of the tub and light\r\nthe 2 white candles<BR>\r\nthat have been dressed with Uncrossing Oil. Stand between the\r\ncandles. Do not dry<BR>\r\nyourself with a towel -- let the bath water dry on you in the\r\nair as the candles burn.<BR>\r\nRecite voice your request in your own words that the jinx be lifted\r\nand the one who<BR>\r\nput it on you be struck down. Pinch out the candles (don\'t blow\r\nthem out) if you intend<BR>\r\nto work this spell for the full 13 days. If you do ill only be\r\ndoing it for one day, just<BR>\r\nlet the candles burn until they go out, no matter how long that\r\ntakes.<BR>\r\nAfter taking this bath, some people then use the remaining bath\r\nwater to wash down<BR>\r\ntheir floors and especially the doorstep of the house. Mix the\r\nbath water into a bucket<BR>\r\nwith some Chinese Wash to make it even stronger. Wash from the\r\nback of the premises<BR>\r\nto the front. Sweep out the front doorway area while the floor\r\nis still wet. Once you are<BR>\r\ndone with the wash water, carry whatever remains out of the house\r\nand pour it on the<BR>\r\nground outside (not down the drain).<BR>\r\nDo this every morning upon awakening -- bathing, praying, lighting\r\nthe white candles,<BR>\r\nand washing down the house -- for 13 days and this will bring\r\nyou relief from crossed conditions.<BR>\r\nIf you know who has put this crossed condition on you and you\r\nwant to reverse the spell<BR>\r\nonto them, the best thing to hope for is to find the mess they\r\nput down -- whether that be<BR>\r\npowders, a doll, or a bottle spell. If you find it, just burn\r\nit all up or throw it into running water.<BR>\r\nNot only will this take the root work off of you, it will send\r\nit back to the one who sent it.<BR>\r\nMost times, unfortunately, you will not be able to find what they\r\nput down to hurt you.<BR>\r\nIn that case, one well-known way to reverse their work back onto\r\nthem is to burn a black<BR>\r\ncandle on their name (putting their name on a paper beneath an\r\noverturned saucer under<BR>\r\nthe candle) or carve their name on the candle. If you use a black\r\ncandle in the figure of the<BR>\r\nDevil and carve their name on it, dress it with Cast Off Evil\r\nOil and things will go harder with them.<BR>\r\nIf you don\'t know the name of the person who did this trick to\r\nyou, carve the words &quot;My Enemy&quot;<BR>\r\non the candle. Burn the black candle on the toilet tank, a little\r\nbit each night, pinching it out<BR>\r\nbetween burnings. Burn it while the moon is growing smaller --\r\nand on the dark of the moon,<BR>\r\nthe darkest night of the month, turn the burning black candle\r\nupside down and extinguish<BR>\r\nit in the toilet bowl, saying &quot;Thus will you, [name of enemy],\r\nmeet your fate!&quot;<BR>\r\nThrow the remaining black candle stub and wax into a crossroads\r\n-- or into the yard of the<BR>\r\nperson who had put the roots on you or jinxed you.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">A SIMPLE REVERSING SPELL<BR>\r\nFirst for this spell you will need:<BR>\r\n1 black and red reversing candle (You may find this in any occult\r\nsupply shop, botanica, etc.)<BR>\r\nor you may use 3 red household candles with the bottom portion\r\ndipped in black wax 1 bag of<BR>\r\nreversing bath salts (or you may use solar sea salt which you\r\nhave consecrated for this purpose)<BR>\r\n1 bag of reversing incense, 1 piece of virgin parchment, 1 vial\r\nof reversing oil India ink which<BR>\r\nhas been consecrated for this purpose, a quill pen to draw upon\r\nthe parchment.<BR>\r\nFirst you must bathe in water with the bath salts, allowing yourself\r\nto air dry after.<BR>\r\nNext, you dress your candle with the oil; anoint the candle starting\r\nin the center and rub the oil<BR>\r\ntowards each end (If using a jar candle anoint the top of the\r\nwax in a counter-clock-wise<BR>\r\ncircular motion, starting at the center and out). Write upon the\r\nparchment that which you<BR>\r\ndesire to be directed away from you in this case psychic attacks\r\n(if you know the source,<BR>\r\nwrite that too). Light the incense and pass the parchment through\r\nthe smoke, then place<BR>\r\nthe parchment under the candle. Light the candle while visualizing\r\na white ball of light forming<BR>\r\nabove it. Then say with all of the force of emotion that you can\r\nmuster:<BR>\r\n&quot;By incense\' smoke and candles\' flame,<BR>\r\nAway from me I send all bane;<BR>\r\nBy cleansing water and power of salt,<BR>\r\nLet any harm come to naught.<BR>\r\nTo any who would wish me pain,<BR>\r\nMay all their curses be in vain;<BR>\r\nAll that blocks me from success,<BR>\r\nWith this spell I lay to rest.<BR>\r\nHarm to None and Good to all,<BR>\r\nLord and Lady hear my call;<BR>\r\nAs I do will, So Mote It Be!&quot;<BR>\r\nRepeat this chant three times As you say the chant, imagine the\r\nsmall white ball above the<BR>\r\ncandle growing and expanding until it encompasses you and anyone\r\nelse who you desire to<BR>\r\nprotect. Imagine that any negative energy that meets this ball\r\nof light will be reflected off, never<BR>\r\ntouching you at all. After the candle has burnt out (about 6 or\r\n7 days for a jar), take the jar<BR>\r\nand any wax left over, and the parchment and place them in a brown\r\npaper bag. Take them<BR>\r\nto a remote location and break the jar inside the bag and dispose\r\nof it. As you dispose of it say:<BR>\r\n&quot;Return to the elements from which thou camest!&quot;<BR>\r\nAs you may have guessed, this is also a success spell in the form\r\nof reversing any negative<BR>\r\nenergies which may be blocking you from the success you desire,\r\nwhatever form that success<BR>\r\nwill take. As for the form of the success; leave that to the Gods.\r\nOh, and if you are using<BR>\r\nhousehold candles, remember to repeat the spell three nights in\r\nsuccession, burning each<BR>\r\ncandle and disposing of the remaining wax after all three have\r\nbeen burnt. This spell will bring<BR>\r\nyou much success and protection if done in the right way.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">REVERSING CROSSED CONDITIONS WITH A BLACK CANDLE<BR>\r\nIf you know who has put a crossed condition on you and you want\r\nto reverse the jinx onto them,<BR>\r\nburn a black candle on their name (putting their name on a paper\r\nbeneath an overturned saucer<BR>\r\nunder the candle) or carve their name on the candle.<BR>\r\nIf you don\'t know the name of the person who did this trick to\r\nyou, carve the words &quot;My Enemy&quot;<BR>\r\non the candle.

Place the piece of paper under the candle holder\r\n(it would probably<BR>\r\nbe smart to put this in a pie plate or some other fireproof container),\r\ncharge the candle with<BR>\r\nyour desire to see these things or trends gone, and light the\r\ncandle, using a lighter only (no matches).<BR>\r\nDo this again for the next two nights, and once you\'re done, burn\r\nthe piece of paper, seeing your life<BR>\r\nas if a weight lifted from it. If there\'s any leftover wax, collect\r\nit in a brown paper bag and bury that<BR>\r\nsomeplace far from you, or throw in a trash can across town! Then\r\nforget about it, don\'t worry over<BR>\r\nit, just know it worked. You can do this whenever you feel the\r\nthings in your life are not going the<BR>\r\ndirection you\'d wish, and different candle colors can be used\r\nfor specific reversals.<BR>\r\nThis is for general, overall reversals.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">BREAKING A MAGICAL BOND WITH ANOTHER PERSON<BR>\r\nSecond, if a person wanted to try a link-break, they would have\r\nto evoke the bond again<BR>\r\n[to break it] ... They could use a simple sorcerous ceremony to\r\nevoke the link. ...<BR>\r\nGet a private room, and draw a diagram on a surface you can stand\r\nand walk around on.<BR>\r\nThey\'d diagram out a central circle one pace in diameter.<BR>\r\nThen they\'d draw another circle about one pace in diameter.<BR>\r\nThen they\'d connect the two circles with a line.<BR>\r\nOn one side of the line would be written the person\'s name.<BR>\r\nOne the other side of the line would be written the other person\'s\r\nname.<BR>\r\nNext two effigies would be prepared. A photograph with a name\r\nwritten on it is nice.<BR>\r\nPeople with old fashioned leanings can make them out of clay or\r\nwax.<BR>\r\nWith some caballa one could make them out writings on sheets of\r\npaper.<BR>\r\nOne effigy is for the person linked to. It\'s put in a bowl or\r\nsomething that cooking wine<BR>\r\ncan burn safely in, like an aluminum kitchen bowl. The second\r\neffigy is of the donor.<BR>\r\nThat can be put into an ordinary kitchen bowl as well.<BR>\r\nNext a series of things in a backwards-seeming order is performed.<BR>\r\nFirst, holding the effigy of the other person, the characteristics\r\nof the other person<BR>\r\nare invoked into it. It\'s then stuck into its bowl and sealed\r\nin its circle; let\'s call it circle B.<BR>\r\nThen the donor\'s effigy has the donor\'s characteristics invoked\r\ninto it and it is sealed into circle A.<BR>\r\nThe link connecting the two persons is then *evoked* from inside\r\nthe donor,<BR>\r\nwith them calling it forth and projecting it into the line connecting\r\nthe two circles.<BR>\r\nThen with some convenient wand or kitchen spoon or something,\r\ntap the line<BR>\r\nconnecting the two circles, invoking the line to represent the\r\nbond between the two.<BR>\r\nThen after walking three times around the whole contraption, counterclockwise\r\nand<BR>\r\nmake drawing gestures with the wand, kitchen spoon, laser pointer,\r\netc. the force<BR>\r\nlinking the two is commanded to decouple and withdraw from the\r\nline into the<BR>\r\nseparate sealed circles. Then the line is broken physically with\r\nthe wand, laser<BR>\r\npointer, whatever and the link is commanded to break and not reform.<BR>\r\nRemaining are two potentized effigies in separate sealed circles.<BR>\r\nIt\'s finished up by taking salt water (Epsom salts are nice) and\r\nbanishing any<BR>\r\nconnection that the donor effigy has with the donor by pouring\r\nthe salt water over<BR>\r\nit without breaking the circle A, while commanding any connection\r\nbe dissipated harmlessly.<BR>\r\nThen cooking wine is poured into the other bowl in circle B and\r\na match is tossed in<BR>\r\nand the command is given for any link that the effigy has with\r\nthe other person to be<BR>\r\ncleanly and harmlessly consumed by the flame . Then the mess is\r\ncleaned up in a normal way.<BR>\r\nIf you should happen to do this, you do it at your own risk, and\r\nare fully responsibility for<BR>\r\nwhatever happens. It\'s a good idea to experiment with cooking\r\nspirits beforehand in a<BR>\r\ncontrolled manner to determine what kind and amount and lighting\r\ntechnique is most<BR>\r\nadvisable in individual circumstances.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">SEPARATION<BR>\r\nWhen we share intimate relationships with people, often we unconsciously\r\ntake on some of<BR>\r\nour partner\'s traits and visa versa. In a close relationship this\r\ncan deepen the connection and<BR>\r\nallow two people to function and relate more easily as one. However\r\nthis condition is not<BR>\r\ndesirable because it ultimately weakens both parties involved.\r\nPieces of your soul become<BR>\r\nartificially incorporated into other people and visa versa.<BR>\r\nSo if the relationship breaks by any circumstance, both parties\r\nmay feel as though they\'re<BR>\r\nmissing parts of themselves, and also are haunted with some of\r\npieces of the other\'s behaviors,<BR>\r\nthinking and emotional patterns, etc. Now, your soul is linked\r\nto you no matter where it has<BR>\r\nbeen stretched to. There are always threads leading back to the\r\nsource which can never<BR>\r\n(or only with deliberate effort) be wholly severed. So by breathing\r\nwith those threads, it is<BR>\r\npossible to retract the lost parts of yourself, and release the\r\nparts which are not yours to keep.<BR>\r\nDo this as follows.<BR>\r\nMEDITATION<BR>\r\nLocate your center. Reach within and locate what is not you.<BR>\r\nExhale and release this out back into the world.<BR>\r\nReach out and feel the scattered bits of yourself.<BR>\r\nInhale and feel those pieces retract back into your center.<BR>\r\nRepeat until ending of meditation. Center yourself again and sit\r\nfor a minute to relax.<BR>\r\nDo this daily until you feel whole again and not psychically attached\r\nto any external persons.<BR>\r\nYou will find that there are far more than just one single person\r\nwho has bits of you out there,<BR>\r\nand far more than just one other person who you\'ve detained within.\r\nIt\'s a form of psychic<BR>\r\nparasitism that almost all people unconsciously partake in on\r\na continual basis (some<BR>\r\nconsciously as well). By doing the above exercise you will reconsolidate\r\nyourself.<BR>\r\nAfter this has happened you will become better rooted with a much\r\nstronger sense of personal<BR>\r\nboundaries, and you can thus better protect yourself from future\r\noccurrences.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">WHEN CURSED BY UNKNOWN PERSON<BR>\r\nSpell and magick be gone (say this three times)<BR>\r\nThat has been placed on me by person(s) known or unknown to me<BR>\r\nGo back from whence you came<BR>\r\nRemain with whom you came from<BR>\r\nBe with who you were sent by<BR>\r\nThen visualize a pyramid going over you.<BR>\r\nI am under universal light and universal protection<BR>\r\nNothing less then universal perfection can touch me were I am<BR>\r\nThe forces of this spell do leave So mote it be.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">9/9/01<BR>\r\n</FONT>\r\n\r\n</BODY>',

Start by calling on your protector.<BR>\r\nOnce you feel its presence, say a simple prayer of protection,\r\nsuch as:<BR>\r\nCreator, Great Spirit, Universal Energy, I call upon your love\r\nand your protection. <BR>\r\nI call upon the beings of light and all those beings that help\r\nlost souls. <BR>\r\nSee this being that has lost its way home. <BR>\r\nIt believes it is of the dark; it has forgotten it is of the light.<BR>\r\nPlease surround it with your love and gently guide it back to\r\nthe light so that it may heal. <BR>\r\nPlease surround this place and all within it with your love and\r\nprotection. I give thanks.<BR>\r\nLight the candle and smudge stick. <BR>\r\nThoroughly smudge the area and yourself and allow the smoke to\r\nclear the area of any negativity. <BR>\r\nThen stand in the center of the room and declare that only beings\r\nof light are allowed in your <BR>\r\naura or dwelling place. Call upon beings of light to protect you\r\nand your location. <BR>\r\nDemand that all lower energy forces leave now and return to the\r\nlight. <BR>\r\nDeclare that this place is only for those who live in love and\r\nlight. <BR>\r\nSee yourself and the room filled with and surrounded by bright\r\nwhite light. <BR>\r\nKnow you are safe and protected. Sprinkle lavender around the\r\nroom. <BR>\r\nMake sure you protect yourself for a few days after you release\r\nthe beings. <BR>\r\nOne way to do this is to visualize your energy field and see it\r\nfilled with white light. <BR>\r\nMentally seal it with white light and see flecks of green and\r\npink light floating around <BR>\r\nyour body. Do this several times a day for the next few days.<BR>\r\nYou tend to be more open to negative beings once one has been\r\nremoved, <BR>\r\nand this process will help seal up your energy field. <BR>\r\nIf you again feel a negative presence, repeat the ceremony.<BR>\r\nThe easiest thing to do is make sure you don\'t attract one in\r\nthe first place. <BR>\r\nIf you remember to call upon your protector and keep yourself\r\nsurrounded by white <BR>\r\nlight, they can\'t get near you.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">TO CONJURE SPIRITS<BR>\r\nWaxing Moon or Full Moon: Waning or New Moon<BR>\r\n- Two tall purple candles -Two tall green candles<BR>\r\n- A purple Amethyst Green Jade or Agate - in center of altar<BR>\r\n- Sandalwood &amp; Lavender Incense Sandalwood &amp; Willow Bark\r\nIncense -Spirit Candle<BR>\r\n- Witches\' Bowl - a bowl or tray 13&quot; or more in diameter,\r\nmarked for divination. <BR>\r\n- Three casting stones<BR>\r\nCast a triple circle.

Once at your altar\r\n(or earth place), light <BR>\r\nthe blue candle and recite the following:<BR>\r\nIt is time to awaken to the cry of the dove, <BR>\r\nHearken to the chimes of the bells of love, <BR>\r\nSpirit rise and soul take flight, <BR>\r\nInto the halls of endless night <BR>\r\nWhere shadows ceases to fall upon <BR>\r\nThe brilliant light of endless dawn. <BR>\r\nThe fire, cold, burns radiant <BR>\r\nConsuming all in sweet content. <BR>\r\nThe joy a pain, the peace a wound, <BR>\r\nThe pain a peace, the joy a boon.<BR>\r\nNext, light the cinnamon stick or chips (the stick works best)\r\nwith the candle flame. <BR>\r\nPass the dove feather through the flame (quickly, so as not to\r\nset it afire) then the <BR>\r\ncinnamon smoke, in that order, three times. While still holding\r\nthe feather, ring your <BR>\r\naltar bell three times. Leave the cinnamon burning in your censure\r\n\'til it goes out on <BR>\r\nits own, and leave the candle burning \'til it does the same. Take\r\nthe feather outside <BR>\r\nand place it under a tree (elder, preferably, but any will do)\r\n-- place it under a different <BR>\r\ntree if you are performing this spell near a tree outside. This\r\nwill set it free, freeing you <BR>\r\nas well. DO NOT touch the feather again, let it leave on its own!</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">HOUSE CLEANSING<BR>\r\nIf you can identify the actual spirit, locate the center point\r\nof the house, and standing there <BR>\r\ntake a cup of red wine. After each of the following statements\r\ntake a sip of wine, <BR>\r\nand drain the cup after the last direction.<BR>\r\nFacing east:<BR>\r\nLady of love and power and all blessings, breathe love into this\r\nhouse, fill air with good. <BR>\r\nThrough you, in you, I bless this house.<BR>\r\nFacing south: <BR>\r\nLady of love and living and all blessings, warm this house with\r\ncomfort, make whole its hearth. <BR>\r\nThrough you, in you, I bless this house.<BR>\r\nFacing west: <BR>\r\nLady of tide and time and every blessing, let every hour flow\r\nsweetly in this house.<BR>\r\nThrough you, in you, I bless this house.<BR>\r\nFacing north: <BR>\r\nLady of strength and riches and all blessings, make this house\r\nstrong and filled with earthly good. <BR>\r\nThrough you, in you, I bless this house.<BR>\r\nWalk around the house saying the following in each room (including\r\nattic and cupboards):<BR>\r\nBe comforted. All is well. Now you are blessed. You have life\r\nto nurture and nurture you. <BR>\r\nBe calm. Be easy. Be comforted. You are blessed.<BR>\r\nIf you can identify the spirit, say the following in the room\r\nmost affected:<BR>\r\nIt is time to leave here. All is well. There is nothing here for\r\nyou. You must be gone. <BR>\r\nGo now, go, complete your passing. Go, and with our blessing and\r\nfarewell.<BR>\r\nOften commanding any evil spirits to leave at once, in the name\r\nof your deity three times works well. <BR>\r\nAfter this you could get a smudge stick of sage, or sage incense,\r\nand perform a house blessing <BR>\r\ncarrying it deosil around the property and from room to room,\r\npaying special attention to doorways, <BR>\r\ncrevices and windows, and also any places that `feel` cold. <BR>\r\nAs you do this with words from a house blessing, scatter salt\r\nand water which has been <BR>\r\nconsecrated and blessed. Have windows and doors open as you bless\r\nthe house. <BR>\r\nSalt scattered along windowsills and doorways will prevent any\r\nentity re-entering the property.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">HEALING SPIRITUAL ILLNESS<BR>\r\nA spiritual illness can be felt in a variety of ways. <BR>\r\nThere may be a feeling of being totally drained, usually a result\r\nof depression (which is <BR>\r\nan illness of the spirit as well as of the mind), there may be\r\naddictions, there may be <BR>\r\na string of bad luck, poor social relationships etc. Spiritual\r\nillness can also produce physical illness. <BR>\r\nIf it is you that is suffering from this illness, cast a circle\r\nand then visualize white light <BR>\r\nstreaming from above into you. You should be able to feel this\r\nlight like a warm wave <BR>\r\nof love. It is the love of The Goddess and of the spirits of your\r\nancestors and guardians <BR>\r\nthat you carry with you always. <BR>\r\nConcentrate on realizing that you are a Star of God sent into\r\nthis world for spiritual <BR>\r\nexperience and that the difficulties you are experiencing are\r\nonly temporary and are <BR>\r\na necessary part of your journey to spiritual enlightenment. <BR>\r\nIncantation:<BR>\r\nGreat Goddess and all you spirits of love that surround me, bring\r\nme blessings. <BR>\r\nBe with me now and forever. <BR>\r\nIf this healing is for someone else, you will of course have to\r\npersuade them to be <BR>\r\ninvolved in this-if the person is a big cynic, this can be a difficult\r\ntask, so perhaps <BR>\r\none of the other healing spells would be a better choice. But\r\nif the person is into it, <BR>\r\ncast a circle, then, as before, visualize white light streaming\r\nfrom above, into your head, <BR>\r\nand through your body. Then lay your hands (which will probably\r\nhave a slight to moderate <BR>\r\ntingling feeling) on the person and send the energy flowing into\r\nthem. <BR>\r\nIncantation:<BR>\r\nYou are filled with the white light of The God/dess. <BR>\r\nYou are a Star of God. <BR>\r\nYou are surrounded by loving spirits. <BR>\r\nGreat God/dess and all you spirits of love that surround (person\'s\r\nname), bring him/her blessings. <BR>\r\nBe with him/her, now and forever.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">THOUGHTFORMS AND SPIRITS<BR>\r\nWhenever we concentrate our thoughts, we draw psychic energy together.\r\n<BR>\r\nThis is called a thoughtform. Usually the energy dissipates as\r\nsoon as we break the <BR>\r\nconcentration, but it is possible to purposely concentrate energy\r\nin this way, producing <BR>\r\nvery strong thoughtforms. Such thoughtforms are vortexes or centers\r\nof psychic energy. <BR>\r\nThey can exist as entities by themselves, at least for a while.\r\nThey are basically inanimate, <BR>\r\nnon-thinking forces. Talking to one is about as logical as talking\r\nto a chair. <BR>\r\nIn this way, thoughtforms are similar to elementals, ghosts, and\r\nspirits. <BR>\r\nAll of these psychic entities consist of a psychic energy vortex\r\nwhich could be described <BR>\r\nas a localized field or as a discontinuity of the physical world.<BR>\r\nPsychic entities respond to certain electrostatic and magnetic\r\nfields, and to other energy vortexes. <BR>\r\nThat is why they respond to Magick ritual. <BR>\r\nPsychic entities are sometimes able to affect our thought processes.\r\n<BR>\r\nThoughtforms and elementals, are usually not very smart. <BR>\r\nIf they display any intelligence at all, it is limited. They are\r\nthe morons of the spirit world. <BR>\r\nTheir behavior is usually automatic, repetitive, robot-like (just\r\nlike some people). <BR>\r\nWe see that artificial elementals are little more than astral\r\nrobots. <BR>\r\nSpirits and deities are more intelligent and volitional. <BR>\r\nDirected Attention <BR>\r\nYour mind follows your attention. <BR>\r\nWherever you direct your attention, there will your thoughts go\r\ntoo. <BR>\r\nBy directing attention to a specific place or purpose you focus\r\nmental energy upon it. <BR>\r\nFor example: you\'re having lunch in a cafeteria crowded with people.<BR>\r\nIt is a large place, and everyone there is talking at once, so\r\nthat the room is a constant jumble of noise. <BR>\r\nYou happen to notice a man across the room; he reminds you of\r\nsomeone. <BR>\r\nAll at once he drops his fork and you hear it hit the table. <BR>\r\nBut would you have noticed the sound of his fork if you had not\r\nbeen looking? <BR>\r\nNo. Only by focusing your attention there were you able to pick\r\nout that individual event <BR>\r\nand associated sound. It is a dark night. You are walking and\r\nthe only light you have is <BR>\r\nfrom the flashlight you hold in your hand. As you move the flashlight\r\naround, the beam <BR>\r\nof light from it directs your attention first one way then another.\r\nNow, the mind is <BR>\r\nsomething like that flashlight in the dark. <BR>\r\nAnd by directed attention, you point the mind to one place or\r\nanother. <BR>\r\nAs with that flashlight beam, you see where the mind is pointed;\r\nnothing more. <BR>\r\nThe rest is \'noise\'. And so we could define mental noise as anything\r\nnot focused upon. <BR>\r\nIn another way, noise could be considered as negative emotions,\r\nattitudes, and thoughts <BR>\r\nwhich make it more difficult to direct the attention. <BR>\r\nYour emotions follow your thoughts quite easily. Your emotions\r\nare not you, but are rather <BR>\r\nreactions prompted by your model and ego -- like a performance\r\nor an act, while the real <BR>\r\nyou watches. In a similar way, directing your attention toward\r\na specific emotion will <BR>\r\ncause you to experience that emotion.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">9/9/01</FONT>\r\n\r\n</BODY>',

A crystal with these characteristics\r\nis itself also called <BR>\r\na POINT. Points may be totally clear and transparent, or they\r\nmay contain streaks, lines, <BR>\r\nrainbows, water bubbles or other inclusions. They may also appear\r\ncloudy if they have <BR>\r\ngrown in a place where it freezes in the winter. Optical clarity\r\nusually has little to do with <BR>\r\na crystal\'s quality and its ability to amplify the subtle energies.<BR>\r\nWHAT CRYSTALS DO<BR>\r\nQuartz crystals are a gift from the earth. They have the ability\r\nto amplify or strengthen the <BR>\r\nthings in you that are positive, and can help you put away things\r\nthat cause you fear or anger. <BR>\r\nThey can strengthen your ability to be a loving person, and can\r\nenhance your abilities to <BR>\r\nenjoy life and accomplish the things you want in life. They can\r\namplify INTENTION, reduce <BR>\r\nstress, help with CENTERING (balancing or calming), strengthen\r\nHEALING abilities, and <BR>\r\nsurround you with PROTECTION by amplifying white light. Any healthy\r\nquartz crystal point <BR>\r\ncan strengthen these things and help produce personal growth by\r\namplifying the subtle <BR>\r\nenergies that flow inside you.<BR>\r\nSELECTING A CRYSTAL<BR>\r\nTo select a crystal, first put yourself in a calm space. Hold\r\nthe crystal in your right hand <BR>\r\nwith the point towards you. Feel it physically. Be open to sensations\r\nlike TINGLING, or <BR>\r\nchange in temperature. Also feel the crystal emotionally. Think\r\nof the purpose you want it <BR>\r\nfor, and see if you feel attracted to it. Be more concerned with\r\nhow it feels than how it looks.<BR>\r\nAllow the crystal to pick you by interacting with it in this way.\r\nAnd remember to go with your <BR>\r\ninitial feeling. If you need a specialized type of crystal to\r\nwork with, consider one of the types <BR>\r\ndescribed below.<BR>\r\nCRYSTALS WITH SPECIAL PROPERTIES<BR>\r\nIn addition to the general characteristics mentioned above, quartz\r\ncrystals sometimes have <BR>\r\nother special attributes that enhance their power. To identify\r\nthese special types of crystals, <BR>\r\npay particular attention to the largest of the faces that slope\r\ntoward the point. Does it have <BR>\r\npyramids (triangles) on it? Count the number of edges surrounding\r\nthe face. This number can <BR>\r\nbe anywhere from 3 to 8, and is one of the things that determines\r\nthe special characteristics <BR>\r\nof the crystal. In addition to strengthening the Inner Being as\r\nall crystals do, the crystals listed <BR>\r\nbelow are true teachers and provide additional special help. Most\r\nof them are relatively rare, <BR>\r\nand they should be highly treasured when one of them finds you.<BR>\r\nCERRIDWEN CRYSTALS <BR>\r\nhave five edges surrounding the largest sloping face. These crystals\r\nstrongly amplify the <BR>\r\nfeminine energy, and can help you get in touch with the \'female\'\r\nor unselfish side of yourself, <BR>\r\nno matter whether you are a man or a woman. These crystals are\r\nuseful in balancing your <BR>\r\nmale-female energy if the female energy has been suppressed, or\r\nif you need a greater <BR>\r\nbalance of female energy for any reason. Cerridwen crystals put\r\nyou in touch with the <BR>\r\npower of the Goddess. <BR>\r\nFor men, the Cerridwen crystal will help you become more in tune\r\nwith your feminine side <BR>\r\nand to become more aware of the aspects of women that you may\r\nfind troubling. <BR>\r\nFor women, the Cerridwen crystal will help you regain some of\r\nthe power and energy <BR>\r\nthat society has taken from you. Teaches that feminine is not\r\nweak. Anyone doing healing <BR>\r\nwork with another person needs the Cerridwen energy to be effective.\r\nThe Cerridwen <BR>\r\ncrystal should be carried or held when dealing with issues that\r\nare emotional and difficult. <BR>\r\nTo nurture yourself, sit with the Cerridwen crystal in your hand\r\nwith the point directed toward you. <BR>\r\nVisualize white light going from the point of the crystal and\r\nsurrounding you.<BR>\r\nAfter doing this you should feel strong and cared for. <BR>\r\nCHANNELING CRYSTALS <BR>\r\nhave seven edges surrounding the largest sloping face. These crystals\r\nare especially useful <BR>\r\nfor obtaining information from deep within yourself or from sources\r\nthat are outside of your <BR>\r\nnormal realm. They can help you draw on the knowledge and information\r\nthat is provided <BR>\r\nby the universe, and can aid you in getting help from a higher\r\nsource. A channeling crystal <BR>\r\ncan be used anytime you are seeking answers or help from outside\r\nof yourself. You must <BR>\r\n`listen\' very carefully when using this crystal and realize that\r\nanswers can come from many <BR>\r\nsources. Meditation is used with these crystals to get knowledge\r\nfrom the universe, and to <BR>\r\ncommunicate with your spirit guide. It can only be used by the\r\nperson holding the crystal.<BR>\r\nCommunication with Guide: A channeling crystal is a line of communication\r\nwith sources <BR>\r\noutside yourself. Generally, the main source is your guide. A\r\nguide is a non-physical entity <BR>\r\nwhose primary job is to look after you. Every human being has\r\na guide. Guides are sometimes <BR>\r\ncalled other things, such as conscience, or angels, but they are\r\nalways with us. We must <BR>\r\nlearn to listen to what they have to say. Your guide will never\r\ntell you what to do, or interfere <BR>\r\nin other ways with what you want to do, but your guide is there\r\nto help you find answers for <BR>\r\nyourself. And you can use your channeling crystal to let your\r\nguide be your conscience. <BR>\r\nA channeling crystal can only be used by the person holding it.\r\nIn other words, you can\'t <BR>\r\nsend the energy to someone else in order to let him receive the\r\ninformation directly. <BR>\r\nHowever, since guides communicate readily with each other, you\r\ncan become good at <BR>\r\ngetting information to people by asking your guide to give you\r\nthe needed information for <BR>\r\nsomeone else, and then relaying it to the person. This is how\r\nyou channel information for others. <BR>\r\nChanneling crystals amplify the quiet inner voice of your guide,\r\nand can be a big help in <BR>\r\nlearning how to channel information, both for yourself and for\r\nothers. <BR>\r\nGROUNDING CRYSTALS <BR>\r\nhave eight edges surrounding the largest sloping face. They are\r\nquite rare and not always <BR>\r\neasily available. Grounding is the ability to deal with practical\r\nmatters in a realistic way. <BR>\r\nFor example, in dealing with the question `How am I going to make\r\na living\', a grounded <BR>\r\nperson will consider his skills and decide how best to use those\r\nskills to make a living.<BR>\r\nAn ungrounded or `spacey\' person does not like to deal with the\r\npractical or realistic aspects of life. <BR>\r\nGrounding crystals help you deal with practical matters in a realistic\r\nway. They connect you <BR>\r\nwith the earth and keep your energies from being scattered. They\r\nhelp you think clearly and <BR>\r\nexpress yourself clearly. When used in meditation they help you\r\nform a strong connection with <BR>\r\nhigher knowledge, but keep you grounded so that you can apply\r\nthat information in practical terms. <BR>\r\nWhen using a grounding crystal to work through a personal problem,\r\nremember that it will require <BR>\r\nyou to look at the truth of the situation and compel you to deal\r\nwith that truth. <BR>\r\nIt is sometimes difficult to recognize times when you need this\r\ncrystal because not being grounded <BR>\r\ncan be a way of life for some people. These days, it is common\r\nto be a little spacey because of <BR>\r\nthings going on in our world. When you are having trouble concentrating,\r\nfeeling a reluctance to <BR>\r\ntackle a task that needs doing, or find yourself running in circles\r\nbut accomplishing nothing, you <BR>\r\nneed a grounding crystal. <BR>\r\nYou can sometimes help another person become more grounded by\r\nsitting quietly, holding your <BR>\r\ngrounding crystal, and visualizing that person being firmly rooted\r\nto the earth. <BR>\r\nWINDOW CRYSTALS <BR>\r\nhave a small diamond shaped face which takes the place of one\r\nof the corners where two <BR>\r\nof the parallel faces usually meet the corresponding two sloping\r\nfaces. Window crystals are <BR>\r\nintrospection crystals in that they help you see what is inside\r\nyourself. They help bring things <BR>\r\nto the surface so you can see them and effectively deal with them.\r\nIf you are having problems <BR>\r\nand aren\'t sure why, a window crystal can be a good help. <BR>\r\nWindow crystals are used for working within yourself to deal with\r\nproblems and changes that <BR>\r\nmust be made in your life. They are used in meditation to help\r\nyou solve problems that are <BR>\r\ntroubling your Inner Being. For example, if you find you are very\r\njealous of a friend, you can <BR>\r\nuse a window crystal to work within yourself to find the reason\r\nand deal with it. <BR>\r\nThink of a window crystal as a window into your soul. These are\r\nvery personal crystals, and <BR>\r\nwhen one comes into your hands, it is intended to help you specifically.<BR>\r\nThis crystal can be used when trying to help someone else solve\r\nproblems. If a friend comes <BR>\r\nto you to talk about a problem have him hold the window crystal\r\nwhile you talk. <BR>\r\nIt can help him open up. <BR>\r\nRECORD KEEPERS have a pyramid shaped indention or elevation that\r\nappears to be etched <BR>\r\non one of the sloping faces. These are fairly rare, and often\r\nthe pyramid will not be noticed until <BR>\r\nthe crystal comes into the hands of the person it was meant to\r\nwork with. Sometimes the pyramid <BR>\r\ncan disappear and sometimes more pyramids show up. Each of these\r\ncrystals has its own special <BR>\r\nlesson to teach, usually the lesson the person most needs to learn.<BR>\r\nRecord keepers differ from window crystals in that window crystals\r\nhelp you look inside yourself <BR>\r\nto let you see the various things you need to learn, while record\r\nkeepers deal with a specific <BR>\r\nlesson that you need to learn. A record keeper will often pass\r\nfrom your hands very quickly <BR>\r\nonce the lesson is learned. <BR>\r\nCarry your record keeper or put it close to your bed so that it\r\ncan work with you. It can also be <BR>\r\nused for meditation. <BR>\r\nSome crystals have several special characteristics, i.e. a Cerridwen\r\nwith a Record. In this case <BR>\r\nthere is a specific lesson to learn that deals with the feminine\r\nside of your energy. If you have an <BR>\r\nCerridwen with a window it means that you need to look inside\r\nto find the areas in your feminine <BR>\r\nside that are causing you problems. <BR>\r\nTWIN CRYSTALS <BR>\r\nhave two terminations (points) at the same end, which have developed\r\nfrom a single base. <BR>\r\nYou can tell a twin crystal from two crystals that are simply\r\nattached to each other, by the <BR>\r\nfact that both parts of a twin crystal are exactly parallel to\r\neach other, and have no boundary <BR>\r\nbetween them in at least a small region of the crystal. These\r\nare wonderful crystals to use <BR>\r\nwhen dealing with `relationship\' things. They can help you gain\r\ninsight into the underlying <BR>\r\nproblems in a relationship, and help work through them. They can\r\ngenerate very positive energy <BR>\r\ntowards improving a relationship. This works for any kind of relationship,\r\nnot only a man-woman <BR>\r\nrelationship. A twin with a rainbow can be very effectively used\r\nto project healing energy into <BR>\r\na relationship or to keep a good relationship strong. <BR>\r\nWhen you are having a problem with a relationship sit quietly\r\nwith the twin and ask for help. <BR>\r\nRemember, that answers come from many directions. <BR>\r\nTwins are personal crystals as one of the twins is very closely\r\ntuned to your energy, so it is <BR>\r\nnot possible to use this crystal to work for others in relationship\r\nmatters. <BR>\r\nDOUBLE TERMINATED CRYSTALS <BR>\r\nare crystals that have points on both ends, allowing energy to\r\nflow readily in both directions. <BR>\r\nDouble terminated crystals strengthen energy flow, and are especially\r\nuseful when you need <BR>\r\nto share or exchange energy between you and another person. They\r\nare useful when you <BR>\r\nare working to help other people, for example in massage or counseling,\r\nwhere energy needs <BR>\r\nto flow in both directions. In these situations, energy flows\r\ntoward you when you tune in to a <BR>\r\nperson to find out what that person needs, and energy flows from\r\nyou when you give the <BR>\r\nperson the needed healing energy. Double terminated crystals are\r\nvery important to people <BR>\r\ndoing healing work for themselves or others. They also help teach\r\nsharing through energy exchange. <BR>\r\nIf working with someone else, visualize energy flowing into you\r\nthrough the top of your head, <BR>\r\ndown your arm, through the crystal, and into the other person.\r\nThis can be done while you are <BR>\r\nwith the person or it can work from a distance. <BR>\r\nIf you have children, try using this crystal to send positive\r\nenergy to the child when the <BR>\r\nchild is upset or angry. It can have a very calming effect on\r\nboth of you. <BR>\r\nGENERATOR CRYSTALS <BR>\r\nare equal sided crystals so that all six sides come to a symmetrical\r\npoint. For channeling and <BR>\r\ndirecting energy of chakras. A Chakra is one of the seven energy\r\ncenters of the human body.<BR>\r\nRAINBOW CRYSTALS <BR>\r\nhave a rainbow reflected from within the crystal. Usually they\r\nare best viewed in sunlight. <BR>\r\nThese crystals are especially good as meditation crystals for\r\nworking deep within the subconscious. <BR>\r\nThey work particularly well to lighten the mood for people experiencing\r\nsadness, grief or depression.<BR>\r\nJust holding a rainbow crystal can lighten your mood. Rainbow\r\ncrystals are also very good at <BR>\r\ndrawing negativity from a room or a situation. Always cleanse\r\na crystal that has been used to <BR>\r\nclear negativity by letting it sit in the sunshine for a while.<BR>\r\nCRYSTALS WITH BABIES <BR>\r\nare crystals that have tiny crystals growing inside a larger crystal.\r\nThese are very good for <BR>\r\npeople who have had traumatic childhoods, physically or emotionally.\r\nThey are helpful for <BR>\r\npeople who are blocking painful memories. They help bring the\r\ncause of the pain to the surface <BR>\r\nand allow the person to successfully deal with it, while shielding\r\nthat person from the pain those <BR>\r\nmemories can cause. These crystals work well for people who are\r\nworking through current family problems. <BR>\r\nWork slowly with this type of crystal, so that things can be cleared\r\nat your own pace. <BR>\r\nYou may not feel inclined to work with it at all in the beginning.\r\nDon\'t force yourself. <BR>\r\nWhen you are ready, you will find yourself drawn to that particular\r\ncrystal.<BR>\r\nYou may have this crystal for years before you use it. Also, sometimes\r\ncrystals come to you <BR>\r\nso that they can go to someone else. For example, someone might\r\nreceive a crystal with babies, <BR>\r\nhave it for some time and not be drawn to it at all. Suddenly\r\nthey will have an urge to pass it on <BR>\r\nto someone else. <BR>\r\nYou can use this crystal in meditation or just keep it close to\r\nyou. <BR>\r\nJust be prepared to deal with whatever comes up. <BR>\r\nTry to have some sort of support around you if you are going to\r\nwork with this crystal. <BR>\r\nTRIGGER CRYSTALS <BR>\r\nhave a smaller crystal growing out from them. This `trigger\' can\r\nbe gently squeezed to <BR>\r\nactivate the power of the crystal and strengthen its attributes.\r\nThese are just used for <BR>\r\na surge of a particular kind of energy. <BR>\r\nSELF-HEALED &amp; PHANTOM CRYSTALS: A self-healed crystal is one\r\nthat has been broken <BR>\r\noff and damaged quite badly, but then begins to grow again. A\r\nphantom is a crystal that has <BR>\r\nhad some impurity drop on it during growth, but then continues\r\nto grow right around the impurity. <BR>\r\nEither of these types of crystal can help you heal from being\r\nhurt, heal from emotional injuries. <BR>\r\nThese are important crystals that will usually come into your\r\nlife at a time when you are carrying <BR>\r\na lot of pain. Just sitting with this crystal will help you deal\r\nwith the pain effectively. <BR>\r\nCLUSTERS: These represent community and are very powerful at clearing\r\nany negative energy <BR>\r\nfrom a room. Just set one out somewhere and allow it to work to\r\nclear the environment. <BR>\r\nAMETHYST/SMOKY CLUSTERS: These particular clusters are mined in\r\na very small area of <BR>\r\nthe Colorado Rockies. They are powerful in keeping the spirit\r\ncentered because they carry a <BR>\r\nspecial kind of energy that keeps all the energy centers within\r\nthe body aligned, balanced, <BR>\r\nand in harmony with each other. <BR>\r\nBRAZILIAN CRYSTALS: Crystals from Brazil have the special quality\r\nof enhancing your ability <BR>\r\nto project energy over a distance. For example, in some of the\r\nabove exercises, where you are <BR>\r\nsending healing energy to someone that is too far away for you\r\nto touch physically, hold a <BR>\r\nBrazilian crystal along with the other crystal to strengthen the\r\ntransmission. <BR>\r\nTIBETAN CRYSTALS: These extremely rare crystals are hand mined\r\nhigh in the mountains of <BR>\r\nTibet, and are carried down the mountainside by backpack. Tibetan\r\ncrystals are for protection. <BR>\r\nJust having a Tibetan crystal close to you puts up an automatic\r\nshield against negative energy. <BR>\r\nIt also helps shield you from other people\'s negative energy.\r\nThis shield is even stronger if you <BR>\r\ndo a centering exercise while holding the crystal.<BR>\r\nCRYSTAL BALL - The sphere is an expression of infinite symmetry.\r\nThe reflected image of a <BR>\r\nperson\'s aura lets the trained interpreter see and know much about\r\na person.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH CRYSTALS<BR>\r\nCrystalline order is at the base of all life. A crystalline structure\r\nconsists of units of energy that <BR>\r\nalign themselves harmoniously with other fellow sub atomic particles,\r\nsort themselves, form <BR>\r\nrepeating rows, layers and lattices according to the laws of nature.\r\nTherefore, crystal is a <BR>\r\ngeneral term for a substance with a systematic ordered structure\r\nin a definite symmetrical <BR>\r\npattern. They are incredibly organised with a highly organised\r\nlatticework. Because of this <BR>\r\norganisation, they have an effect on organising energy fields\r\naround them. Crystalline <BR>\r\nstructures are bones, muscles, water, salt, rock, wood, gemstones\r\nand quartz. From this<BR>\r\nit can be seen, that a human being is a crystalline structure!<BR>\r\nModern physicists have affirmed that all physical form consists\r\nin essence, not of matter, <BR>\r\nbut energy. Therefore the nature of physical matter is dynamic,\r\nmoving and dancing. <BR>\r\nTherefore everything that exists is an external manifestation\r\nof an energy form, a vibration. <BR>\r\nWe can therefore say that all crystalline structures are highly\r\norganised patterns of energy, <BR>\r\nyet each individual structure has its own vibration or frequency\r\nrate. Natural quartz crystals <BR>\r\nhave extremely high and exact rates of vibration that can be precisely\r\nmanipulated to <BR>\r\naugment, store, amplify, transfer, transform and focus other rates\r\nof vibration. Because of <BR>\r\nthese qualities quartz crystals can be used to modify thoughts,\r\nemotions, and bodies by first <BR>\r\neffecting changes on the subtle non-physical planes (energy fields).<BR>\r\nQuartz consists of four oxygen atoms plus one silicon atom to\r\nmake one molecular unit. <BR>\r\nGroups of these units link together to form spirals of molecular\r\nunits that create a three <BR>\r\ndimensional latticework of systematic uniformity. They are 6 sided\r\nwith two sides parallel <BR>\r\nto one another which reflects the hexagonal structure of pure\r\nquartz molecules (like a beehive!). <BR>\r\nThese six sides also correspond to the six major chakras in the\r\ntrunk and head of the physical <BR>\r\nbody with the point corresponding to the seventh chakra.<BR>\r\nThis structure responds in a precise and predictable way to all\r\nenergy - light, heat, sound, <BR>\r\nthought waves, electricity - by the molecular units oscillating\r\nat high speeds back and forth <BR>\r\nto unite and create specific vibrations that pulse through the\r\ncrystal to the surrounding <BR>\r\nenvironment. <BR>\r\nThe quartz crystal receives energy, processes it, then transmits\r\nthe oscillations outward in <BR>\r\nprecise vibration patterns. Whatever is projected in comes out\r\nin a focused and amplified way. <BR>\r\nThe quartz crystal does not distinguish from dark and therefore\r\nthe key is the INTENT of the <BR>\r\nperson using the crystal. <BR>\r\nThus, our journey into crystalline energies is a journey into\r\nthe self. The crystal is an energetic <BR>\r\nmirror to allow us to look deeply and honestly at ourselves. </FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Programming Crystals<BR>\r\nThe only crystal that can be programmed is Quartz. First make\r\nsure your crystal is cleansed. <BR>\r\nSit in a quiet place and still your mind. Think clearly about\r\nwhat thought you want the crystal <BR>\r\nto hold, take a deep breath, holding the crystal in your left\r\nhand, blow your intention onto the <BR>\r\ncrystal. This is a very powerful way to program the crystal. You\r\ncan programme a crystal to <BR>\r\nhelp you do most things. Try and use different crystals for separate\r\nthings. Use one for healing, <BR>\r\none for information storage, one for music, etc. </FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Cleansing Crystals<BR>\r\nWhen you first get a crystal it will need cleansing because it\r\nwill have picked up many energies <BR>\r\non its way to you. there are several ways of doing this. It can\r\nbe left in full sunlight for a day, also <BR>\r\nin full moonlight. Running water is good, fresh water, rivers,\r\nstreams. Visualisation of the crystal <BR>\r\nin a mountain steam, or flooded with white light, is also a good\r\nway. Your intent must be pure. <BR>\r\nNever use hot or warm water. Always cleanse after it has been\r\nused in any sort of healing and <BR>\r\nwhen you want to re-programme it. </FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Charging Crystals<BR>\r\nCrystals need to be charged up, somewhat like a car battery. The\r\nway to do this is very similar <BR>\r\nto cleansing. Again in the sun, under the moon, any holy place,\r\nby a stream or river. Leave as <BR>\r\nlong as you feel is right. Don\'t leave them in draws or dark places\r\nthey like to be out in the open <BR>\r\nto work to their full potential. </FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Wearing Crystals<BR>\r\nUsually worn round the neck, stimulating the thyroid and increasing\r\nthe efficiency of the <BR>\r\nimmune system. Also assists the respiratory system and sore throats.\r\nWhen the crystal is <BR>\r\npointing down it is grounding, soothing and calming. Giving energy\r\nto all systems. When <BR>\r\npointing upwards this strengthens the spirit and gives a general\r\nuplift. A double terminated <BR>\r\ncrystal (pointed at both ends) is excellent to use as it balances\r\nthe two, giving a combination of both. </FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">MORE ON CRYSTALS<BR>\r\nChoosing, Cleansing, Clearing And Programming<BR>\r\nAll crystals need to be treated with respect and love. If they\r\nare used as a tool, do so with <BR>\r\nhumility and gratitude. In choosing a crystal, it is necessary\r\nto find one that vibrates in harmony <BR>\r\nwith the self and with the specific purpose for which you are\r\nbringing it into your life. <BR>\r\nLike attracts like. Each human and each crystal has its own vibration.<BR>\r\nIn front of you is a tray of crystals - quartz and others. Look\r\nat them. Feel them. There are a <BR>\r\nnumber of ways to know which is right for you. Instant rapport\r\n- is there one that you instantly <BR>\r\nare drawn to? Strong energies - move your hand over the top and\r\nfeel the energies from <BR>\r\neach and see which one you are drawn to. Physical attraction -\r\nis there one that you really, <BR>\r\nreally like the look of and must pick it up and feel it? <BR>\r\nNow you have your quartz crystal what do you do with it? It now\r\nneeds to have the outside <BR>\r\ncleansed. The best way to do this is with luke warm soapy water.\r\nThis cleans the outside of <BR>\r\nthe vibrations of its travels from the miner to the buyer to the\r\nimporter, to the wholesaler etc. <BR>\r\nIt also needs cleaning when it is dirty, dusty or has body oil\r\non it from your handling. Just as <BR>\r\nyou need a shower or bath on a regular basis, so do your crystals.\r\nMany also like to bathe <BR>\r\nin the light of the moon. My preference is the moon rather than\r\nthe sun. All your crystals like <BR>\r\nto be cleaned, be they quartz or gemstones. I do not clean my\r\ncrystals in salt of any kind as <BR>\r\nmany books recommend. Salt is crystalline. If you look at your\r\ncrystals, you may see very <BR>\r\nminute cracks. If a piece of salt goes into that crack and stays\r\nthere, it could crack the crystal. <BR>\r\nQuartz crystals store vibrations that come from sound, light,\r\ntouch, emotions, other bodies, <BR>\r\nphysical environment and affects those coming in contact with\r\nthe crystal. Thus, they need <BR>\r\nto be cleared before working with them and after they have been\r\nused; when it appears to <BR>\r\nlack vitality or looks dull; and to neutralise internal programs.\r\nPlease remember that they are <BR>\r\nan energy storage device. To clear, you will hold the quartz in\r\nyour hands and pulse with the <BR>\r\nmental intent to clear. Crystals are also programmed with the\r\nuse of the pulse breath. Both the <BR>\r\nclearing and programming are done with quartz crystals only as\r\nthe coloured stones have <BR>\r\ntheir own innate programs. When humans and quartz crystals work\r\ntogether, the crystal <BR>\r\nbecomes a very sensitive and precise tool. They accumulate the\r\nintentions/programs of <BR>\r\nthe user; magnify and amplify them; focus them and feed them back\r\nto the environment.<BR>\r\nWhen we program, the crystal is keyed to our personal vibration\r\nand thus it becomes an <BR>\r\nextension of self. The storage of programs in a crystal is similar\r\nto the storing of data on a <BR>\r\ncomputer chip.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">METAL MAGICK<BR>\r\nProperties of some common metallic elements and their uses for\r\nmetal Magick in rituals and spells. <BR>\r\nALUMINUM *Projective/Mercury/Air/Male <BR>\r\nAluminum is the most abundant metallic element on the earth and\r\nthe moon. 8% <BR>\r\nof the earth\'s crust is composed of aluminum in some form.

It is because Jet &amp; Amber are the only combination that\r\ncome from the same source yet embody <BR>\r\nboth the God AND the Goddess aspects! How? Amber is a fossilized\r\nresin, and is the Male element. <BR>\r\nIt is the Sun, the Light ~ Ra. Jet, on the other hand, is dark,\r\nmysterious, female ~ Moon But they both <BR>\r\ncome from the same source! Amber is the resin, jet is the tree\r\nitself, the wood transformed...so the <BR>\r\ncombination of the two is ALL, dark/light, male/female, sun/moon.<BR>\r\nAMBER <BR>\r\nAmber is not, technically a stone but a fossil. It is also the\r\noldest known gem to be used my man <BR>\r\nas an adornment. Amber is fossilized resin from ancient conifers.\r\nMost Amber is found washed up <BR>\r\non the beach but there are fields of buried trees that also contain\r\nAmber, the Amber that comes <BR>\r\nfrom New Zealand is like that. Russian (also known as Baltic)\r\nand Dominican Amber,<BR>\r\nhowever, are usually a beach-combers dream! <BR>\r\nTrue Amber is pre-Jurassic, any Amber that is younger than that\r\nis called Copal. A lot of Amber <BR>\r\ndoes contain bugs, I have seen pieces with hundreds of specimens,\r\nand I have one that I wear <BR>\r\nthat has 17. It can also have small &quot;critters&quot; like\r\nlizards, but those pieces are extremely rare. <BR>\r\nMany pieces also have leaves, twigs and bark in them. Some have\r\ndroplets of air, that over the <BR>\r\nmilleniums have compressed and become shiny discs that look like\r\nsun spangles. <BR>\r\nIn olden times they used to make pipe stems from Amber with the\r\nbelief that the gem did not retain <BR>\r\ngerms and was antiseptic. I know many people that swear that wearing\r\nan Amber pendant will <BR>\r\nrelieve arthritis. It is also said that wearing Amber will protect\r\nyou from radiation. The golden color <BR>\r\nof Amber is associated with the sun, and with the solar plexus\r\nChakra. In Middle Eastern belief the <BR>\r\nChakras are the connections of the soul to the body, and the main\r\n&quot;entry&quot; point is the solar plexus Chakra.<BR>\r\nAs such, the Higher Self connects to the physical self through\r\nthis Chakra, and the wearing of Amber <BR>\r\nwill strengthen this connection.<BR>\r\nJADE<BR>\r\nThere are several shades of Jade, from a pale, soft green, to\r\nwhite, to lavender, red, yellow, and the <BR>\r\nemperor of Jade, Imperial Jade, which is a deep green color. Imperial\r\nJade got its name from the last <BR>\r\nempress of China, who revered - and collected - it. When a piece\r\nwas unearthed it had to go directly <BR>\r\nto her, and she kept a lot of it, over 3,000 cabinets full of\r\nit. <BR>\r\nThe Chinese have revered Jade for as long as can be remembered.\r\nIt is used for Happiness, Longevity, <BR>\r\nProsperity, Protection, Joy, Love and Wisdom. <BR>\r\nChinese people will often wear several pieces hanging from their\r\nbelt, the melody caused by the <BR>\r\nJade pieces as they jingle brings joy and peace. Confucius said\r\nof Jade &quot;Wise men have seen in <BR>\r\nJade all the different virtues. It is soft, smooth and shining\r\n- like<BR>\r\nkindness; it is hard, fine and strong - like intelligence; it\'s\r\nedges seem sharp, but do not cut, like justice. <BR>\r\nIt hangs down to the ground, like humility; when struck, it gives\r\na ringing sound, like music; the stains <BR>\r\nin it which are not hidden and which add to its beauty are like\r\ntruthfulness; it\'s brightness is like <BR>\r\nHeaven, and it\'s fine substance is like the earth, born of the\r\nmountains and water.&quot; <BR>\r\nKwan Chung wrote of it in the seventh century BC<BR>\r\nthat Jade symbolizes to the Chinese nine of the highest attainments\r\nof Man &quot;In it\'s smoothness <BR>\r\nhe recognizes Benevolence, In it\'s high polish - Knowledge Emblematic,\r\nIn it\'s unbending firmness - <BR>\r\nRighteousness, In it\'s modest harmlessness - Virtuous Actions,\r\nIn it\'s rarity and spotlessness - <BR>\r\nPurity, In the way it exposes every flaw - Ingenuousness, In that\r\nit passes from hand to hand <BR>\r\nwithout being sullied - Moral Conduct, And that when struck it\r\ngives forth a sweet note that floats <BR>\r\nsharply and distinctly to a distance - Music.&quot; <BR>\r\nJade does come from other places then China, notably, a very high\r\nquality of Jade comes from <BR>\r\nNew Zealand. The Maories traditionally make a totem called a Hei\r\nTiki from it. These tikis are handed <BR>\r\ndown from generation to generation and are highly prized.<BR>\r\nCHALCEDONY<BR>\r\nEnergy: Receptive<BR>\r\nPlanet: Moon<BR>\r\nElement: Water<BR>\r\nPowers: Peace, Anti-Nightmare, Travel, Protection, Lactation,\r\nLuck <BR>\r\nMagickal Uses: Chalcedony, in common with many other stones, banishes\r\nfear, hysteria, <BR>\r\ndepression, mental illness, and sadness. It also promotes calm\r\nand peaceful feelings when <BR>\r\nworn or held in the hand.<BR>\r\nIn the 16th century it was prescribed by magicians to dissolve\r\nillusions and fantasies. <BR>\r\nFor this purpose it was pierced and hung <BR>\r\naround the neck.<BR>\r\nWorn to bed or placed beneath the pillow, chalcedony drives away\r\nnightmares, night <BR>\r\nvisions and fears of the dark.<BR>\r\nAs a protective stone, chalcedony guards its bearer during times\r\nof political revolution <BR>\r\nand while traveling. It is also used to ward off psychic attack\r\nand negative Magick. <BR>\r\nChalcedony prevents accidents if worn.<BR>\r\nIn Renaissance magic the chalcedony was engraved with the figures\r\nof a man with his <BR>\r\nright hand upraised. This was worn for success in lawsuits as\r\nwell as for health and safety.<BR>\r\nThe stone is used for beauty, strength, energy and success in\r\nall undertakings, and in Italy, <BR>\r\nmothers wear beats of white chalcedony to increase lactation.\r\nAn arrowhead carved of <BR>\r\nchalcedony is worn and carried for luck.<BR>\r\nAMETHYST<BR>\r\nAids in development of magickal skill, spiritual connections,\r\nlove, clarity, divination, wisdom, <BR>\r\ncourage, psychic growth, dreaming, <BR>\r\nprotection, healing and balancing energy.<BR>\r\nCorresponding oils<BR>\r\nFrankincense: protection, purification, strengthening<BR>\r\nClary Sage: wisdom, protection, purification, divination<BR>\r\nSandalwood: protection, spirituality and harmony<BR>\r\nLavender: love, peace, balancing, purification, protection<BR>\r\nRosemary: protection, love, purification, courage<BR>\r\nAVENTURINE<BR>\r\nUsed for healing, sexual well-being, activating and expanding\r\nyour imagination, enhancing <BR>\r\ncreativity, and drawing prosperity to you. Carried as a good-luck\r\ncharm, strengthens perception.<BR>\r\nCorresponding Oils<BR>\r\nClove: protection, prosperity, purification, love and mental powers<BR>\r\nAlmond: prosperity and wisdom<BR>\r\nBalsam Fir: prosperity and mental clarity<BR>\r\nGinger: prosperity, love, power, healing, strengthens and warms\r\nthe spirit.<BR>\r\nNutmeg: luck, prosperity, fidelity, increases dreams, strengthens\r\nand calms.<BR>\r\nKYANITE<BR>\r\nKyanite actually comes in several colors. Most are familiar with\r\nblue, but it also comes in black, <BR>\r\ngreen and pink. Pink Kyanite is often confused with Rubellite,\r\nand indeed does look a lot like <BR>\r\nthe Rubellite that grows in Lepidolite (Rubellite is also known\r\nas Pink Tourmaline) Pink Kyanite <BR>\r\nis somewhat denser and the host stone is white. Green Kyanite\r\nis also what is known as Gem-quality. <BR>\r\nIt is more translucent/transparent and often has a blue striation\r\n~ or vein ~ running through the middle, <BR>\r\nlengthwise. Black Kyanite is very striated and fans out from the\r\ntip to the end. It has a tendency to <BR>\r\nflake off little needles, so handle with care! Blue Kyanite is\r\na beautiful, mid-to-dark blue, translucent <BR>\r\nstone. The more you use it the darker it will get. Kyanite is\r\nnot really indigenous to this planet. It does <BR>\r\ngrow here but did not originate here. If you look at Black Kyanite\r\nyou can see how it looks like it fell <BR>\r\nlike an arrow to the Earth. I mostly use two types of Kyanite,\r\nBlue &amp; Black. Kyanite is an Astral stone, <BR>\r\nby which I mean it is used to facilitate<BR>\r\nAstral Projection. Why is it so good for this? Not being from\r\nhere it does not have the signature <BR>\r\nvibration of the Earth so it makes it easier for us to also separate\r\nfrom it. To use Blue Kyanite, <BR>\r\ntake it in your left hand, place your hand over your heart and\r\nrelax. Blue Kyanite will first clear <BR>\r\nand center you. Why? Because if you are not cleared and centered\r\nyou cannot properly leave <BR>\r\nthe body. Relax into the stone and just drift...the rest is up\r\nto you and the stone! Blue Kyanite will <BR>\r\ntake you where you want to go, in contrast Black will take you\r\nwhere you need to go. To use <BR>\r\nBlack you must have two pieces, one in each hand. Lie down with\r\nyour hands by your side and <BR>\r\nrelax...Just remember, you MUST come back! At the least Kyanite\r\nwill put you in a very deep <BR>\r\nmeditative state. use it in Balancings to get the ego of the person\r\nout of the way so the other <BR>\r\nstones and the energy work will not be blocked. The energy runs\r\nlengthwise through Kyanite, <BR>\r\nand just like Tourmaline if you heat one end you will feel the\r\nwarmth at the other end. Meaning if <BR>\r\nyou want to use it to project energy it is ideal for that, as\r\nis Tourmaline or Aquamarine (or Quartz <BR>\r\nfor that matter!) <BR>\r\nBENITOITE<BR>\r\nBenitoite crystallizes forming slightly flattened pyramid shaped\r\nor tabular crystals. The color ranges <BR>\r\nfrom colorless to blue, pink, purple, and white; some of the crystals\r\nare partially colorless and partially <BR>\r\ncolored. It has been found exclusively in California, <BR>\r\nUSA. <BR>\r\nThis mineral can be used to enhance contact with extra terrestrial\r\nbeings, once contact has been established. <BR>\r\nIt can also aid in allowing transmission of thoughts between two\r\npeople( without verbalization). <BR>\r\nThe stone has been used successfully in the laying on of stones\r\nto raise the experience of astral <BR>\r\ntravel to a higher degree. <BR>\r\nBenitoite brings lightness and joy with depth of beauty and thought\r\nto the wearer, enhancing <BR>\r\nmovement and activity. <BR>\r\nIt is a great benefactor to the well being of ones physical, emotional,\r\nand intellectual selves; the <BR>\r\nenergy brings the message and helps one to realize that ones passage\r\nthrough time and space is <BR>\r\nnot arbitrary and indiscriminate and that one is, indeed, <BR>\r\nat all times in the right place, at the right time. <BR>\r\nIt is an excellent stone, useful for expediting the healing process\r\nand for integrating and releasing the <BR>\r\nbasic cause of disease. <BR>\r\nIt has been used in the treatment of disorders of the blood, to\r\nameliorate conditions of excessive <BR>\r\nbleeding, and to strengthen the walls of the veins.<BR>\r\nBAVENITE<BR>\r\nBavenite crystallizes in the form of fibrous radial groupings\r\nof prismatic crystals. The color is white. <BR>\r\nThis mineral can be used to enhance ones self image and to provide\r\nincentive to grow spiritually, <BR>\r\nemotionally, and intentionally. It brings a softness to ones spirit,\r\nyet encourages a righteousness with <BR>\r\nrespect to ones privilege to grow in the highest direction. <BR>\r\nIt promotes flowering of the self during the right season. The\r\nmessage of the energy of <BR>\r\nBavenite instills the knowledge that one must never accept deficiencies\r\nwithin oneself; if <BR>\r\none accepted less than perfection, one would be grasping the belief\r\nthat lack is universal will. <BR>\r\nIt allows one to delay judgement until all relevant information\r\nis available. It also provides for <BR>\r\nproficiency in intellectual endeavors. <BR>\r\nIt continues to encourage one to open to creativity, providing\r\nfor a vast expanse of information<BR>\r\nwith respect to the nature of creation. Bavenite can be used in\r\nthe treatment of disorders of <BR>\r\nspeech, hearing, sight, smell, and touch. It can stimulate the\r\nwellness attribute within the inner <BR>\r\nbeing, allowing for mental and structural alignment and physical\r\nwell being.<BR>\r\nLAPIS LAZULI<BR>\r\nDeep rich blue, often has gold or iridescent colored flecks. Sagittarius\r\n(Archer) SAGITTARIUS (NOV. 22 - DEC. 21)<BR>\r\nAquarius (Water-bearer) AQUARIUS (JAN. 20 - FEB. 18)<BR>\r\nRevered throughout the ages as Holy, and a connection with the\r\nvery Gods themselves...<BR>\r\nLapis is a stone of Protection, a stone of Communication, a stone\r\nof Awareness, a stone of <BR>\r\nEnlightenment, a stone of courage.<BR>\r\nHISTORY<BR>\r\nThe ancient Egyptians used it extensively as a dye for cloth,\r\na make-up (the original blue <BR>\r\neyeshadow) and, of course, in jewelry and decoration. One of the\r\nmost popular items was <BR>\r\nLapis carved into a Scarab. It was also pulverized and given as\r\na poison antidote, as it was <BR>\r\nthought to cleanse the body of impurities and toxins. Small children\r\nthat are timid are given <BR>\r\nLapis to impart Courage. It is a very soothing and peaceful stone,\r\nless abrupt than the royal blue in it\'s energy.<BR>\r\nWHAT IS LAPIS LAZULI?<BR>\r\nLapis is a Third-Eye stone, incredible for placing on the 3rd\r\neye in meditation...also for interdimensional <BR>\r\ncommunication and scrying... Since Lapis is such a deep blue color\r\nand has flecks of pyrite in it, it <BR>\r\nresembles the night sky and is good for Dreaming. It is also said\r\nthat connecting with the pyrite flecks <BR>\r\nis like connecting with the stars and the Celestial Beings.<BR>\r\nLapis is a stone of Venus. It is also a stone of Peace, and has\r\nbeen used against depression <BR>\r\nand melancholy. Lapis lazuli increases psychic abilities. Penetrates\r\nthrough psychic blockages <BR>\r\nto reveal inner truth. It helps meditation and is useful for &quot;neutral\r\nperception&quot; in emotional issues. <BR>\r\nThis stone\'s for understanding higher self, overview, decisions\r\nfor good of all. It stimulates wisdom, <BR>\r\ntruthfulness and can help organize one\'s life and protect the\r\nwearer. It promotes the connection <BR>\r\nbetween the physical plane and the celestial kingdom. It also\r\nfurthers connectedness between <BR>\r\nmale and female. Improves self-statement, writing, creativity,\r\ndream insight...sooths and balances <BR>\r\nanxiety, restlessness, insomnia, autism, shyness, nervous system;\r\nMS, speech, hearing, pituitary, <BR>\r\nDNA, lymph, inflammation, pain (especially head).<BR>\r\nLapis Lazuli points the way to enlightenment, and it aids the\r\nopening of the Third Eye. It is a gem <BR>\r\nof contemplation and meditation. Stones with deep luminosity and\r\nbright, exotic blues are the most <BR>\r\nuseful. Gold flecks of pyrite inclusions give the stone unusually\r\npositive energy. The opening of the <BR>\r\nChakras is facilitated with Lapis Lazuli. It has a fine quality\r\nenergy that must be sought out.<BR>\r\nWhen Lapis was first introduced to Europe, it was called ultramarinum,\r\nwhich means beyond the sea. <BR>\r\nGround lapis was the secret <BR>\r\nof the blue in ultramarine, the pigment which painters used to\r\npaint the sea and the sky until the nineteenth <BR>\r\ncentury. Lapis was also popular in inlays. The columns of St Issac\'s\r\nCathedral in Petersburg are lined with <BR>\r\nlapis and the Pushkin Palace in Petersburg has lapis lazuli paneling!\r\nThe Romans believed that lapis was <BR>\r\na powerful aphrodisiac. In the Middle Ages, it was thought to\r\nkeep the limbs healthy and free the soul from <BR>\r\nerror, envy and fear.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">STONES<BR>\r\nAdventurine: General healing, dissolves unhealthy thoughts and\r\nreflects healing. </FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Amethyst: Induces meditation and devotional\r\nstate.

Imagine yourself bathed in a stream\r\nof pure energy which <BR>\r\nruns from the crystal through your hands and into your body. <BR>\r\nSleep with the crystal under your pillow.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">SENDING BAD STUFF AWAY<BR>\r\nTo the Goddess, I do pray<BR>\r\nGrant me power, strength to flay<BR>\r\nThis one\'s curse<BR>\r\nWith these words, I hold thee at bay.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">STRENGTH CEREMONY<BR>\r\nWe all have times in our lives when things are hard and we don\'t\r\nhave much faith in ourselves. <BR>\r\nI recommend doing this ritual whenever the feelings of doubt or\r\nfear start clouding your thoughts. <BR>\r\nThis is a group ritual, but it is possible to modify it for a\r\nsolitary practitioner. <BR>\r\nCast the circle and then go around the circle so everyone can\r\nsay how they became strong.<BR>\r\n&quot;I became strong through facing my fears.<BR>\r\nI became strong through my friends.<BR>\r\nI became strong through my family.<BR>\r\nI became strong through making mistakes.<BR>\r\nI became strong through taking a stand. <BR>\r\nI became strong through dreaming.&quot;<BR>\r\nChant and raise power. The above can be modified to be more personal.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">THE RING OF STRENGTH<BR>\r\nThis can be used for any battle, if made and used properly. <BR>\r\nThe colors and words can obviously be altered to fit your own\r\nneeds.<BR>\r\nI chose the colors listed below because they represented the things\r\nI consider to be <BR>\r\ncharacteristics of strength. The male population will obviously\r\nwant to look up their <BR>\r\ncolors and altar the spell to their liking. What you need:<BR>\r\nRed, blue, orange, purple, black, yellow and silver string (appropriate\r\nfor making a bracelet).<BR>\r\nCandles the colors of the strings (or 7 white candles) Tape Scissors<BR>\r\nWhat you do:<BR>\r\nSay the following once, before you start the making the ring of\r\nstrength, <BR>\r\nonce when you\'re half done making the ring of strength, and once\r\nwhen you are <BR>\r\nfinished with the ring of strength:<BR>\r\nI bring survival, protection and courage with each red, blue and\r\nblack knot<BR>\r\nAnd with each orange, purple and silver I\'ve tied, it was just\r\njustice, <BR>\r\nfemale power and self assurance that I got.<BR>\r\nWill yellow, quick intelligence is with me - secure my knots -\r\nthese <BR>\r\nthings held together tightly...<BR>\r\nBy my will So mote it be!</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">TO MAKE THE RING OF STRENGTH BRACELET<BR>\r\nTake a piece of each color - all at equal length. Make the length\r\nvery <BR>\r\nlong, for you\'ll need a lot of string.<BR>\r\nDraw the strings together at one end and knot them, making them\r\ninto <BR>\r\none. Find something (something you can put tape on) - a table\r\nor...something <BR>\r\n(unless you can think of a better way) and tape the knot down\r\nsecurely. <BR>\r\nNow take the first string, starting at the left and tie it once\r\nwith the second string. <BR>\r\nTake the second string and tie it to the third string. <BR>\r\nTake the third string and tie it to the fourth string and so on\r\nuntil you\'ve tied the second from <BR>\r\nthe last string to the very last string. Now take the last string\r\nand tie it to the second from <BR>\r\nthe last string (and so on like you just did, only going backwards).<BR>\r\nKeep doing this, going back and forth, until you have a long,\r\nknotted bracelet that <BR>\r\nwill tie securely around your wrist. This may take a while and\r\nis a lot of hard work, <BR>\r\nbut believe me it\'s well worth it. When you\'re done knotting,\r\ntie your new <BR>\r\nbracelet/ring of strength around your left wrist and simply wear\r\nit all the time.<BR>\r\nIt will give you strength. When the bracelet feels it has given\r\nall it\'s worth...it <BR>\r\nwill simply fall off one day. If you don\'t feel you have <BR>\r\nenough strength....you might need to make another.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">SPELL OF THE COMB AND MIRROR<BR>\r\nPurify area, cast circle, etc. Burn a white candle for yourself,\r\nand say:<BR>\r\n&quot;O Lady of shimmering beauty,<BR>\r\nFor whom the stars are shining jewels<BR>\r\nAnd the Universe Her creation and plaything,<BR>\r\nWeaver of destinies and Protectress of things wild and free<BR>\r\nMake me now, I do ask, to be thy daughter<BR>\r\nMake me one with thee and grant me thy far-flung power<BR>\r\nGrant to this, thy Witch and Sorceress<BR>\r\nStrength within and without.<BR>\r\nAs eternal as the boundless sea,<BR>\r\nThe calm assurance of my powers<BR>\r\nTo make any do my bidding,<BR>\r\nAnd the winds, waters, and fires,<BR>\r\nThe hills themselves lend willingly themselves to me.<BR>\r\nGive to me, who am of thy ancient Craft<BR>\r\nThe wisdom of ages, the lore of eons,<BR>\r\nKnowledge of light, knowledge of dark.<BR>\r\nGrant me beauty ever more perfect<BR>\r\nThat I may reflect thee better.<BR>\r\nBuild magick within me, build power within me.<BR>\r\nPower be drawn and power come.<BR>\r\nAnd make me one with thee.<BR>\r\nMake me greater, make me better<BR>\r\nGrant me strength and grant me power.<BR>\r\nO Goddess who is my friend and mother,<BR>\r\nI give you love and thanks<BR>\r\nO Beautiful One, may the magick I have summoned<BR>\r\nReturn the stronger when I have need of it<BR>\r\nSo mote it be!&quot;</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE="-1">SPELL OF STRENGTH<BR>\r\nQuickly clear your mind and say this.

In Rome the broom was a symbol of Hecate's priestess,\r\nwho swept the threshold of a house<BR>\r\nafter each birth to remove evil spirits that might harm the child.<BR>\r\nThe broom also used in weddings, signifying sexual union. Wedding\r\ncustoms included jumping over a<BR>\r\nbroom. Medieval peasant weddings were churchless and came under\r\nthe area of common law. The<BR>\r\nbroom was so closely identified with nonecclesiastical marriages\r\nthat by the time of the Renaissance,<BR>\r\nwhen the church began to take over wedding rites, marriages &quot;by\r\nthe broom&quot; were considered illegitimate.<BR>\r\nChildren ride a broomstick with a toy horse head at one end. This\r\nis copied from Sufi mystics who<BR>\r\nentered Spain in the early Middle Ages. They organized themselves\r\ninto groups of 13, like covens.<BR>\r\nThe Sufi sages rode horse-headed canes called zamalzain, &quot;gala\r\nlimping horse.&quot; The dervish's stick<BR>\r\nhorse stood for the Pegasus-like fairy steed that carried him\r\nto heaven and back.

Because of the sexual symbolism involved, the\r\nword &quot;besom&quot; was used as slang to<BR>\r\ndescribe a &quot;loose&quot; woman.<BR>\r\nThe broom is used in ritual and magic. This tool is sacred to\r\nboth the Goddess and God. Pre-Columbian<BR>\r\nMexico worshiped a goddess who rode naked on a broom, so this\r\nidea is not new.<BR>\r\nThe broom became a powerful tool against curses. Even today many\r\npeople hang a broom on the<BR>\r\nfront door of their home, but most do not know the symbolism of\r\nit.<BR>\r\nThe area to be used for ritual is swept clean with the broom.\r\nThe sweeping is more than a physical<BR>\r\nsweep of the area.

It is a spiced gruel used\r\nfor healing. This was given to people<BR>\r\nwho were confined and to those who came to see a new baby at home.<BR>\r\nThe cauldron is an ancient vessel of cooking, full of magical\r\ntradition and mystery. It is often the focal<BR>\r\npoint of rituals. During spring rites it may be filled with flowers.\r\nDuring winter you may have a small fire<BR>\r\nin it to represent the returning heat and light of the sun (the\r\nGod) from the cauldron (the Goddess).<BR>\r\nThe cauldron may be used for scrying (gazing) by filling it with\r\nwater.<BR>\r\nThe cauldron should be of iron with three legs.

Some Wiccans carve special patterns or runic symbols\r\non their candles,<BR>\r\nalthough this is not necessary.<BR>\r\nUse fresh candles that are not cracked for each spell. Let the\r\ncandles burn down.<BR>\r\nDo not leave the candles unattended.

Or go to a fabric store\r\nand search through the remnants.<BR>\r\nThese are often at least 1 yard in size, and cost 50% or less\r\nof their original price.<BR>\r\nSheets and remnants can be embroidered, appliqu&eacute;d or painted\r\n(fabric paint) with symbols<BR>\r\nand other designs. Make sure the fabric is washable though. Market\r\nin England have wonderful<BR>\r\nremnant boxes where you can get washable velvet curtain material\r\nthat would be ideal with<BR>\r\nsilver or gold fringe and a pentagram applied with embroidery\r\nor fabric paints.<BR>\r\nIncense:<BR>\r\nCheck the spice and herb shelf at your grocery stores and Health\r\nfood shops.<BR>\r\nThere are many dried whole and powdered herbs and spices that\r\ncan be used individually or in<BR>\r\ncombination for incense. Save your money to buy those which are\r\nnot available through the<BR>\r\ngrocery store (I.e. frankincense, myrrh, copal). Same idea applies\r\nto herbs for magickal use.<BR>\r\nYou can grow things like lavender and sage and thyme and many\r\nother herbs and flowers<BR>\r\nin pots or in your garden. Try steeping herbs in a virgin olive\r\noil or nice base oil for like<BR>\r\nJojoba or a few weeks and make your own oils.<BR>\r\nCenser:<BR>\r\nShops charge a pretty penny for censors (I'm talking of normal\r\ncensers, not the little cone ones),<BR>\r\nso don't buy them there. Check discount stores, jumble sales or\r\nflea markets and garage or boot<BR>\r\nsales for suitable containers. If money is tight, try using a\r\ndeep natural seashell or even aluminum<BR>\r\npie pans. Fill with sand or cat litter and set on a hot pad or\r\na trivet (just to be safe). The charcoals<BR>\r\nused for burning incense get *very* hot, so be careful with choosing\r\nwhat you will use....<BR>\r\nsome materials have very low heat tolerance/resistance.<BR>\r\nChalice:<BR>\r\nHave you a nice goblet or wine glass at home? Use that. No need\r\nfor anything fancy.<BR>\r\nIf you keep your eyes open, you can find a nice crystal or glass\r\ngoblet fairly inexpensively at<BR>\r\nstores such as Boot sales, Jumble sales, Charity shops and Second\r\nHand shops or Woolworth's<BR>\r\nif in England; or garage sales if you are American try Wall- Mart\r\nand Kmart, kitchen shops, flea<BR>\r\nmarkets. You can buy a glass engraver tool or use silver or gold\r\nenamel paint or special silver<BR>\r\nor gold pens from craft shops to inscribe pentacles and decorations,\r\nWicca blessings or chants etc.<BR>\r\nCandle holders:<BR>\r\nFill jars with sand and stick the candle into the sand. You can\r\npaint symbols on the jars if you like<BR>\r\nto represent the elements, etc. The small votive candles can be\r\nburned in small aluminum pans<BR>\r\n(pot pie size...I've even seen custard cup size for sale in grocery\r\nstores). Even some of the larger<BR>\r\npillar candles can be burned in these pans. Candles can also be\r\nburned in seashells and cans<BR>\r\nof appropriate size. See above for candle holders brought second\r\nhand in brass and copper.<BR>\r\nMake your own candles from kits. Amazing moulds can be made from\r\nwet sand lined with Clingfilm.<BR>\r\nI have also used unraveled toilet rolls inside of glass jars,\r\nthe cardboard is peeled away easily<BR>\r\nafter the hot wax hardens. Wax crayons can be added to make different\r\ncolors.<BR>\r\nBuy white candles and prick them all over, now add a mixture of\r\nsea - salt and food coloring<BR>\r\nand dip the candles to get any color you wish. it`so the vibrations\r\nof the color the spell is<BR>\r\nrequiring and it saves raised eyebrows about you having so many\r\ncolored candles.<BR>\r\nRobes and sandals:<BR>\r\nNot essential. What you wear is a matter of choice, unless you\r\nbelong to a coven that specifies<BR>\r\nwhat you wear. In solitary practice, it's just you and the deities.\r\nYou can make a robe from a dyed<BR>\r\nor bleached sheet or buy a caftan type of garment kept just for\r\nrituals. Of course it simple and<BR>\r\nit's often recommended for witches or be sky-clad. Covens tell\r\ntheir members to make their<BR>\r\nown ritual robe and to bless each magickal stitch they sew. They\r\nare supposed to only be worn<BR>\r\nfor ritual use. Scour the<BR>\r\nshops for jet and amber beads to find beads to make a priestesses\r\nnecklace to wear.<BR>\r\nYou can look for cheap beads to sew into a Mandela to meditate\r\nwith.<BR>\r\nAthame:<BR>\r\nIt will take time to find the right one for you. It can be the\r\ntraditional style, or it can be a dagger<BR>\r\nor knife that has special meaning to you. Go to pawn shops, flea\r\nmarkets, and garage sales to<BR>\r\nkeep the cost down. Look for letter openers and things like that!.\r\nBefore buying, handle the knife.<BR>\r\nIf it doesn't feel right, or if it doesn't call to you in some\r\nway, it's not the one for you. If you've<BR>\r\nhandled a knife and still aren't sure about it, don't buy it right\r\naway...go back and handle it several<BR>\r\ntimes over a period of a week or two. Until such time as you find\r\n*your* Athame, any dagger or long<BR>\r\nbladed knife will suffice. The handle may be painted white or\r\nblack or left in it's natural wood effect.<BR>\r\nWands:<BR>\r\nIt's best to make your own. Take walks in parks, along beaches\r\nor in the woods.<BR>\r\nKeep your eyes open for branches laying on the ground. Handle\r\nthe branch and see what<BR>\r\nimpressions come to you. If it's meant to be a wand for you, you'll\r\nfeel it. You can add the<BR>\r\nskull of an animal personal to your coven . The thing is to personalize\r\nit and to keep the natural<BR>\r\nlife-force to maximize the energy . Wicca [protection balls are\r\nmade easily from Christmas tree<BR>\r\nclear ornaments and silver paint. Scrying mirrors are also easily\r\nmade by spraying any ordinary<BR>\r\nglass black with a spray enamel paint and setting it back in an\r\nattractive metal or wooden frame<BR>\r\nyou can make look Magickal with emblems and symbols painted on\r\nand herbs put inside the<BR>\r\n&quot;scrying mirror&quot; to make it special and personal. The\r\nsame method applies to finding other useful<BR>\r\nitems such as seashells, stones, etc. Feathers can make magickal\r\nquill pens or are handy to waft<BR>\r\nincense smoke or represent the element of Air. Seashells hold\r\nwater and salt and can represent<BR>\r\nthe element of North as can stones. A Lava stone or pumice stone\r\ncan represent the element of fire.<BR>\r\nStaffs:<BR>\r\nSee wands ....just use a bigger branch. Try a Do it yourself shop\r\nto find a sturdy wood rail you<BR>\r\ncan chop to size. A small piece of dowel can make a wand, A copper\r\nwand filled with herbs<BR>\r\nis a good conductor Magick.<BR>\r\nMore on Jewelry:<BR>\r\nSometimes there is no helping the expense of this if you want\r\nquality. Jewelry is not essential,<BR>\r\nbut if a piece is especially meaningful, it can be a useful tool\r\n(at least in the sense of your<BR>\r\nmainframe or mindset). Of course, you can find good jewelry at\r\ngood prices at flea markets,<BR>\r\npawn shops and garage/estate and boot sales and second hand shops.<BR>\r\nMore on Altar Pentacles:<BR>\r\nYou can make one out of flour &quot;clay&quot; and paint it. You\r\ncan make one out of a square of wood,<BR>\r\nand either paint or burn the pentagram, or even carve it.. At\r\nmany hardware and larger home<BR>\r\nrepair supply stores, you can find a tile and paint it. The cost\r\nof any of these will be a fraction<BR>\r\nof a pentacle ordered through a catalog or bought in most stores.<BR>\r\nON SAVING MONEY<BR>\r\nThe main thing to remember is that you don't have to spend a lot\r\nof money. Take a good look<BR>\r\naround your home, and look at things with the idea of making it\r\na useful tool. Use your imagination<BR>\r\nand creativity. Even if you don't have the money, frequently visit\r\nyour favorite shop and look<BR>\r\nthrough catalogs. This way, if something goes on sale, you'll\r\nhave a good idea whether or not it's<BR>\r\nreally a bargain price. And haunt the discount stores...there's\r\nno telling what useful items you<BR>\r\nwill find at great prices.<BR>\r\nAlso remember that not every tool or item you read about in the\r\nbooks is essential.<BR>\r\nBefore buying or making something, ask yourself &quot;Do I really\r\nneed this in order to practice my beliefs?&quot;<BR>\r\nIf you save money on tools and at the same time create things\r\nthat are beautiful and personal<BR>\r\nthey will be far more magickal than any brought item. The money\r\nsaved an go towards things<BR>\r\nlike Amber and Sandalwood resins, gums and incenses and herbs\r\nand barks that you cannot<BR>\r\ngrow yourself. Remember to consult the herbal and incense correspondences\r\nyou have as it`<BR>\r\nso possible to substitute different herbs in spells if you have\r\nnot got one or two of the things<BR>\r\nstipulated!

It can be a small table,\r\na mantelpiece, windowsill,<BR>\r\na shelf in a bookcase, or whatever else is handy in the house.\r\nIt can be round, to represent<BR>\r\nthe Goddess, square, symbolic of the elements, rectangular or\r\noval. It may be a small area of<BR>\r\nground in a field or wood.<BR>\r\nYou may decorate it with crystals, talismans, herbs, flowers,\r\nor my favorite, feathers.<BR>\r\nAnything that has special meaning to you. It is a reflection of\r\nthe person who puts it together.<BR>\r\nIt is considered best to place the altar facing north. This direction\r\nsymbolizes the power<BR>\r\nflow from darkness to light. It is associated with the Earth.\r\nSome face the south with their<BR>\r\naltars to honor the sun as it rises. The altar is usually stands\r\nin the center of the circle.<BR>\r\nWe do not believe the Goddess or God actually &quot;inhabit&quot;\r\nthe altar. It is a place of power.<BR>\r\nWe are not &quot;idol worshipers&quot;. These are manifestations\r\nof the creative forces found in nature<BR>\r\neverywhere. It may be set up permanently or dismantled after use.<BR>\r\nAltar Setup<BR>\r\nThe Goddess is associated with the left side of the altar.<BR>\r\nThe Goddess may be represent by a white, silver, or green candle.<BR>\r\nA sculpture or some sort of figure may be used.<BR>\r\nTools that are associated with the Goddess are the Cup, Pentacle,\r\nBell, crystals and Cauldron.<BR>\r\nIf the Cauldron is large, it is usually placed on the floor to\r\nthe left.<BR>\r\nThe God is associated with the right side.<BR>\r\nA sculpture or a figure of some sort may be used to represent\r\nthe God.<BR>\r\nA red, yellow or gold candle is appropriate.<BR>\r\nTools associated with the God are, the Censer, Wand, Athame, and\r\nBoline.<BR>\r\nThe Censer and Cauldron are sometimes set in the middle for offerings\r\nto both Goddess and God.<BR>\r\nThe Pentacle is sometimes set in front of the censer. It marks\r\nthe Directions and/or Elements.<BR>\r\nMany Wiccans mark North, South, East and West with candles on\r\nthe altar, space permitting.<BR>\r\nUnless you have a very large altar, you will need a stand for\r\nthe Book of Shadows,<BR>\r\nor place it on the floor where you will not step on it. As you\r\ncan see, it is up to you to find<BR>\r\nwhat is pleasing. Altar cloths are sometimes used.

If doing a spell<BR>\r\nthat calls for burning the paper, this ink will strengthen what\r\nyou are writing. Perfumed inks are<BR>\r\nalso great for writing notes and letters to your loved ones. The\r\nmaking of perfumed ink is very easy.<BR>\r\nSimply purchase a bottle of ink, either black or colored, and\r\nadd 2 or 3 drops of the appropriate<BR>\r\nessential oil to the bottle. Let the bottle of ink sit on your\r\naltar overnight. This is best done on the<BR>\r\nFull Moon for positively-charged inks, on the Dark Moon for negatively-charged\r\ninks. My tip for<BR>\r\na love letter is to mix red and blue Indian or types of inks together\r\nand add some lavender essential<BR>\r\noil or some diffused lavender essence or just leave the lavender\r\npetals in the inks and put in the<BR>\r\nsun or airing cupboard for a week and then strain. It is supposed\r\nto be the thing for writing love<BR>\r\nletters and spells. As good as the Doves blood ink!</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE=\"-1\">HOW TO MAKE AND USE CHARMS<BR>\r\nTrace each symbol in red ink (either Doves Blood or Dragons Blood\r\ndepending upon the situation),<BR>\r\nmarker while concentrating on the symbol's purpose.<BR>\r\nIf you print in color, trace the symbols with your blood.<BR>\r\nPray or do a personal ritual to consecrate each individual charm\r\nand charge it with its purpose.<BR>\r\nCall upon the power of God/dess, or other entities that may be\r\nuseful.<BR>\r\nThe consecration ritual may include burning a copy of the charm.<BR>\r\nHowever, keep another copy to carry with you in a mojo bag of\r\nthe appropriate color.<BR>\r\nYou may also want to add a lodestone to the bag for extra power.<BR>\r\nIf you do, remember to &quot;feed&quot; your lodestone at every\r\nfull moon<BR>\r\nRunes make excellent focus points for meditation.<BR>\r\nThe meditation will then set you on your path toward your desired\r\ngoal.<BR>\r\nCarry the piece of paper with you in a pocket or in your wallet.<BR>\r\nLay it under your pillow or on your night table when you sleep.<BR>\r\nThe charms will last as long as the piece of paper.<BR>\r\nIf you want to make more sturdy charms, carve and paint the symbols\r\nonto pieces of wood.<BR>\r\n(Do not laminate the piece of paper. You could, however, make\r\nseveral copies and<BR>\r\nconsecrate all at the same time.)</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE=\"-1\">TO PROTECT AN OBJECT<BR>\r\nWith the first and middle fingers, trace a pentagram over the\r\nobject to be protected.<BR>\r\nVisualize electric blue or purple flame streaming from your fingers\r\nto form the pentagram.<BR>\r\nSay this as you trace:<BR>\r\n&quot;With this pentagram I lay<BR>\r\nProtection here both night and day.<BR>\r\nAnd the one who should not touch<BR>\r\nLet his fingers burn and twitch<BR>\r\nI now invoke the law of three:<BR>\r\nThis is my will, so mote it be!&quot;</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE=\"-1\">HOW TO CHARGE (MAGNETIZE) WATER<BR>\r\nStand or sit comfortably with a container of the water you wish\r\nto magnetize in front of you.<BR>\r\nInvoke your personal and god symbols.<BR>\r\nPerform exercise to activate positive energy.<BR>\r\nConcentrate for a while on the type of energy you wish to infuse\r\ninto the water.<BR>\r\nPlace the palm of your dominant hand over the water.<BR>\r\nHold your weaker hand, palm up, at shoulder or waist level, whichever\r\nis most comfortable.<BR>\r\nYour arm may be bent at the elbow; your had should be relaxed\r\nand open.<BR>\r\nYour weaker hand draws the desired energy from the universe.<BR>\r\nThis energy is then channeled to your dominant hand.<BR>\r\nThe energy flows out your dominant palm and into the water.<BR>\r\nContinue channeling the energy into the water until you feel it\r\nis sufficiently charged.<BR>\r\n(Optional) Before you begin the charging process you may, if you\r\nwish, place a crystal or herb<BR>\r\ninto the water. This adds nature's magnetism to your own. (It's\r\nbest not to drink water charged<BR>\r\nin this manner unless you are absolutely sure the crystal is clean\r\nand the herb nonpoisonous.)<BR>\r\nSeal your aura.<BR>\r\nNOTE: Don't be concerned if you can't feel the energy flowing\r\nfrom one hand to the other and<BR>\r\ninto the water. Energy follows thought. If you mentally intend\r\nenergy to flow in a particular<BR>\r\ndirection, it will do so. Since water doesn't hold a charge for\r\nvery long, use your magnetized<BR>\r\nwater immediately. (To prolong the &quot;life&quot; of your charged\r\nwater, ask spiritual or elemental<BR>\r\nenergies to add their magnetism to the water.)</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE=\"-1\">TOOL MAKING<BR>\r\nCreature of earth, thou firm salt of law,<BR>\r\nthou sharp salt of truth, be thou purified and sanctified as a\r\ntool of my will.<BR>\r\nCreature of water, gentle and receptive, be thou purified and\r\nsanctified as a tool of my will.<BR>\r\nBe now one, the salt sea-water of the Mother's womb, to bless\r\nand purify all who partake<BR>\r\nof this rite.

As the wood must be obtained from a\r\nliving tree, you may not be<BR>\r\nable to obtain the specific type you desire. But fortunately,\r\nmost trees, especially fruit trees,<BR>\r\nwill work adequately in magic. During the construction of the\r\nmagic wand you will use your<BR>\r\nmagic knife. Take a purification bath and then dress in clean,\r\nplain clothes, or a robe.<BR>\r\nGo to the tree. Walk thrice around its truck clockwise, pointing\r\nyour knife at the tree, and<BR>\r\nsaying words similar to these:<BR>\r\nO Great Tree, O Strong Tree,<BR>\r\nI ask thee to give me of your wood to further me in the magical\r\nart of herbalism.<BR>\r\nThou shalt grow strong by my stroke; stronger and taller, O Great\r\nTree!<BR>\r\nFinished, select an appropriate branch, straight with few leaves\r\nor twigs growing out of it.<BR>\r\nA length of perhaps 15 inches is sufficient to allow shaping and\r\nsanding, and a width of not<BR>\r\nless than one-half inch is fine.<BR>\r\nWith your magic knife cut the branch tenderly, whispering your\r\nthanks to the tree.<BR>\r\nTie a red bow around the trunk or bury an offering of bread, wine,\r\nor a precious stone at its base.<BR>\r\nAfter returning home, remove all extraneous growth from the main\r\nshaft.<BR>\r\nSand with a fairly coarse sandpaper to remove the bark, then shift\r\nto a lighter paper to smooth it.<BR>\r\nThen wipe with a dry cloth to remove the wood dust. Now anoint\r\na cloth with pure frankincense<BR>\r\nor sandalwood oil and rub the wand well with this. Put away in\r\na dark place wrapped in a yellow<BR>\r\ncloth for seven days. On this night take it out and lay it upon\r\nthe bare earth.<BR>\r\nTouch the point of your magic knife to the wand, saying these\r\nor similar words of like meaning:<BR>\r\nI consecrate thee, O Wand of (type of tree), by the virtues of\r\nthe Earth,<BR>\r\nAir, Fire, and Water, that thou shalt truly be a magical Wand,\r\npossessed of<BR>\r\nbounteous powers and uses. By this sign thou shalt be an aid and\r\nsuccor to me.<BR>\r\nNow, setting the knife aside (or, sliding it in your belt or sheath)\r\nhold the wand in your strong hand.<BR>\r\nGrasp firmly. Now invoke any god you worship.<BR>\r\nRepeat the invocation in each of the four directions (you don't\r\nhave to be exact in these; it's okay<BR>\r\nto guess). Many feel more comfortable working magick in the name\r\nof a god or goddess.<BR>\r\nAlthough magic is non-religious, it is not non-spiritual.<BR>\r\nIf you feel more at ease flavoring your magic with religion, by\r\nall means do so.<BR>\r\nThis is where the wand will come in hand, on calling upon your\r\ngods to witness your rites or to<BR>\r\ncharge them with extra power. Raise the wand aloft in your strong\r\nhand when invoking or<BR>\r\npraying to deities, calling upon the powers of Earth, Air, Fire,\r\nand Water, or when<BR>\r\ndealing with any non-human entity.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE=\"-1\">SPELL FOR CLEANSING NEW WAND<BR>\r\nBoil water in a copper cauldron and mix in sea salt.

Why might this be so?<BR>\r\nAbove all else this is because pointing or directing energy is\r\none of the most<BR>\r\ncommonly used ritual acts in all ways and paths. As simple as\r\nthat- if you want to point<BR>\r\nor direct energy or intent at anything in a ritual way, it generally\r\nfeels symbolically and<BR>\r\naesthetically much more powerful to do so with something than\r\nit does if you use your finger.<BR>\r\nThis being so it helps if you have a special device to use in\r\nthis way- A Wand.<BR>\r\nDesigns of Wands can vary from the ceremonially and symbolically\r\nextravagant to the<BR>\r\nsublimely simple. A stick picked up on a country walk will suit\r\nsome, a creative product<BR>\r\nof three months work will suit others. Preparing wood for use\r\nas a Wand if you are going<BR>\r\nto decorate a Wand in any way.<BR>\r\nBringing a piece of wood from one environment- laying on the ground\r\noutdoors or still<BR>\r\nattached to its parent tree, to inside your home, will cause changes\r\nin it.<BR>\r\nThe most major of which is that it will dry out. Even a dry piece\r\nof stick picked up in<BR>\r\nmidsummer from your local woods is likely to have more moisture\r\nin it than it will have<BR>\r\nafter a few days of being in your home, so unless you work with\r\nyour stick very soon<BR>\r\nafter gathering it, it will begin to split or even warp.<BR>\r\nThe first hint for this is then to stabilize the wood as quickly\r\nas possible.<BR>\r\nThe simplest way to do this is to give the stick a good coat of\r\nvarnish that has been thinned<BR>\r\ndown with Turpentine so as to replace the moisture and stick all\r\nthe fibers of the wood together.<BR>\r\nIf you use a matt finish varnish you will avoid a high gloss appearance\r\non the wood, or else if<BR>\r\nyou use a gloss varnish you can sand that down so that it doesn't\r\nshow with fine grade sandpaper.<BR>\r\nAn alternative is to use beeswax dissolved into a thin cream with\r\nturpentine.<BR>\r\nYou can slather this on quite thickly so that it's absorbed by\r\nthe wood, and remove the<BR>\r\nsurplus with a soft cloth. If you're going to decorate or carve\r\nyour wand you need to do this before<BR>\r\nvarnishing or waxing, as wax in particular will prevent paint\r\nfrom sticking, and make it difficult to carve.<BR>\r\nIf you cut a Wand from live wood but don't plan to work with it\r\nfor a while, then keep it somewhere<BR>\r\ncool and more moist than indoors. Such as in a shed or garage.\r\nIt's best to leave the bark on wood<BR>\r\nthat is going to be stored a while to prevent it splitting as\r\nit dries. If you're going to work it straight<BR>\r\naway then remove the bark straight away also as this is much easier\r\ndone when the wood is freshly cut.<BR>\r\nWoods to use: Most traditions and ways have symbolic associations\r\nof trees to draw from for<BR>\r\nWand source woods, and much ritual magic and Witchery will offer\r\nmore ideas and inspirations.<BR>\r\nWhen drawing from these sources bear in mind the practicalities\r\nof why ancestral peoples or cunning folk<BR>\r\nchose to use particular woods- what qualities were they looking\r\nfor? What associations might they<BR>\r\nhave been drawing from? If you look at things in these ways you\r\nwill clearly see that as well as mythic<BR>\r\nand symbolic qualities, most traditions also wove in the practical\r\nqualities of specific woods- Hazel,<BR>\r\nAsh and the wood of fruiting trees have long been used as Wand\r\nwoods in Britain and Ireland.<BR>\r\nHazel produces Wand sized branches all in one year that have produced\r\nneither<BR>\r\nflowers nor fruit in that year and are therefore 'virgin'- unfertilized\r\nand still having<BR>\r\nthose qualities of potential yet unexpressed. Hazel is also a\r\ngood<BR>\r\nwood for carving, and these one year branches grow dead straight.<BR>\r\nAsh has similar qualities and is excellent to carve. Both Hazel\r\nand Ash are also very white woods.<BR>\r\nApple trees also make these long straight branches that are virgin\r\nin the same way as Hazel, and<BR>\r\nApples have powerful mythic and symbolic associations. The 'traditional'\r\nlength of a Wand is that<BR>\r\nlength from your elbow to the tip of your middle finger. From\r\nsuch a measurement that involves the<BR>\r\nmeasurer fully in the process we can see the magical principle\r\nof sacred measure-<BR>\r\nsomething that grows out of a relationship between the measurer\r\nand that which is measured and<BR>\r\napportioned. A far more powerful principle than using a rule or\r\ntap measure to impose an arbitrary<BR>\r\nmeasure upon a magical tool of this kind.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE=\"-1\">INNER POWER POUCH<BR>\r\nIngredients: Purple bag or cloth Vervain Dragon's blood resin\r\nRosemary<BR>\r\nFrankincense Galangal or ginger root High John oil, personal power\r\noil or Dragon's blood oil<BR>\r\n1 Clear quartz crystal A personal talisman Purple Candle<BR>\r\nDirections:<BR>\r\nI suggest making up your own directions and spell for this one\r\nbecause it is a very personal pouch.<BR>\r\nAdd ingredients or objects that have meaning to you.

Find yourself an old wooden or metal picture frame.<BR>\r\nMake sure that the frame is a dark color, as shiny frames tend\r\nto reflect in the finished mirror.<BR>\r\nI prefer an oval or even better a round frame of about 12&quot;\r\nin diameter.<BR>\r\nDon't get one too big; you will want to carry it around sooner\r\nor later.<BR>\r\nWith very little effort these can be found for a couple of dollars\r\nat any second hand store, antique shop,<BR>\r\nor Goodwill Store. Flee markets, garage sales, and swap meets\r\nare a gold mine for these frames and I<BR>\r\nhave bought beautiful ones for as little as .25 cents. Don't bother\r\nif the frame is a little beat up, you can<BR>\r\nalways paint or refinish it, but be sure the glass is unscratched\r\nand clear. For a dollar or two glass can<BR>\r\nbe replaced. I have also bought a round piece of glass and lead\r\ntrim from a stained glass supply<BR>\r\nhouse and made some beautiful gifts from these. I have even trimmed\r\nthem in stained glass.<BR>\r\nTotal cost? About $20.00.<BR>\r\n2. Buy a can of high gloss spray enamel paint. Read the label\r\nand make sure it is good for glass.<BR>\r\nSome paints are not. This can be found at any hobby shop, or hardware\r\nstore.<BR>\r\n3. Remove the glass and clean it well with a good glass cleaner.\r\nLet it dry for several hours.<BR>\r\n4. Place the clean glass on a large piece of newspaper, being\r\ncareful to handle it by the edges<BR>\r\nso as not to get finger oil on the surface. Spray paint the glass\r\nusing quick even light passes back<BR>\r\nand forth until the glass is covered completely. WARNING! do not\r\nallow the paint to run! If you do<BR>\r\nthe painting outdoors, be sure it is a sunny windless day. You\r\ndo not want the paper or other debris<BR>\r\nto blow onto the wet paint and it takes several hours to dry so\r\nas to be hand led.<BR>\r\n5. Apply a second coat if necessary, but for the best effect it\r\nis best to do this in one coat.<BR>\r\nThe mirror effect will be flawless that way.<BR>\r\n6. Place the glass back into the finished frame and you have your\r\nBlack Scrying Mirror.<BR>\r\nBelieve me, it is every bit as good as any you can find for sale.<BR>\r\n7. Empower the mirror with a Full Moon Spell or any spell which\r\nworks for you.<BR>\r\nOnce consecrated it is infused with your own personal magnetism\r\nand should not be<BR>\r\nhandled by anyone else. If someone picks it up, reconsecrate it.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE=\"-1\">THE PENTAGRAM: AN EXPLANATION<BR>\r\nThe pentagram, or five-pointed star, may be the most misunderstood\r\nreligious symbol around these<BR>\r\ndays. Being the most common symbol of Neo-Pagan Witchcraft, it\r\nhas nevertheless been<BR>\r\ndenigrated by movie and publishing industries which seem 'hell-bent'\r\non connecting it with<BR>\r\nSatanism and other malevolent practices. However, like the Roman\r\nCross or Crucifix, it is only<BR>\r\nwhen the symbol is INVERTED that it alludes to negativity.<BR>\r\nAnd even then, there are exceptions, as we shall see. In its usual\r\nupright position (one point<BR>\r\nuppermost), the pentagram is an ancient symbol of protection from\r\nevil. Also called 'the endless<BR>\r\nknot' (in its interlaced form), the pentagram was often displayed\r\non doors, windows, and hearths<BR>\r\nof houses throughout pre-Christian Europe. It can be traced back\r\nto Egyptian and Sumerian cultures,<BR>\r\nand has even been found on Native American medicine tools. Sometimes\r\nmistakenly confused with<BR>\r\nthe Star of David, or hexagram (a six-pointed star emblematic\r\nof Judaism), the pentagram is sometimes<BR>\r\ncalled the Star of Solomon, especially by ceremonial magicians.<BR>\r\nTo many, the lower four points represent the classical elements\r\nof earth, air, fire, and water, while<BR>\r\nthe fifth point, surmounting the others, represents spirit, the\r\nfifth element or quintessence. Thus,<BR>\r\nthe pentagram symbolizes the four elements of the material world\r\nconnected with, but ruled by, the<BR>\r\nspirit. When the pentagram is placed within a circle (symbol of\r\nunity and wholeness), it stresses our<BR>\r\nconnection with the universe as a whole.<BR>\r\nAnother interpretation is that there is not one point upward --\r\nbut three! In numerology, three is the<BR>\r\nnumber of harmony, best expressed in the classical formula: thesis,\r\nantithesis, and synthesis. In<BR>\r\nother words, it is the middle point that harmonizes the opposing\r\nouter points. The Celtic love of triads<BR>\r\n(the most common form of their 'wisdom literature') has its roots\r\nin this model. The upper three points<BR>\r\nare thus placed above the lower two points, which represents dualistic\r\nopposites that cannot<BR>\r\nbe integrated or harmonized (seeing everything in black and white).<BR>\r\nYet another interpretation of the upright pentagram is that it\r\nsymbolizes the most common view of<BR>\r\ndeity in Witchcraft. The upper three points represent the Goddess\r\nin her threefold aspect of Maiden,<BR>\r\nMother, and Crone. The lower two points represent her consort\r\nGod, in his twin aspects of God of<BR>\r\nLight and God of Darkness. However, in all these interpretations,\r\nit is important to remember that<BR>\r\nall the points are connected -- each an aspect of the other, all\r\npart of the same whole.<BR>\r\nBut when the pentagram is inverted, so is its meaning. Thus, an\r\ninverted pentagram may represent<BR>\r\nthe physical world (four material elements) in domination of the\r\nworld of spirit (the fifth element).<BR>\r\n(This may be why Satanists and other 'demonistic' groups use this\r\nsymbol.) With two points uppermost,<BR>\r\nit may also express a Neo-Platonic dualism (the old 'war in heaven',\r\ngood vs. evil theme) -- as opposed<BR>\r\nto the Pagan monistic view of reality ('the Force') seen in the\r\nsingle point upward. The most common<BR>\r\nexception to this rule is that some traditions of Witchcraft (chiefly\r\nBritish) employ the inverted<BR>\r\npentagram as a POSITIVE symbol of advanced degree. In this case,\r\nthe two points uppermost<BR>\r\nrepresent the horns of light, symbol of 'the Horned God', consort\r\nto the Great Goddess (like the<BR>\r\nGreek god Pan).<BR>\r\nThe word 'pentacle', sometimes mistakenly substituted for pentagram,\r\nreally refers to a shallow<BR>\r\ndish (usually inscribed with a pentagram) and used as an altar\r\ntool by modern Witches, serving<BR>\r\na purpose similar to the 'patten' at a Roman Catholic Mass. Common\r\nvariations of this tool include<BR>\r\na dish of earth, a disk of copper, a dish of silver, or a disk\r\nof wax.<BR>\r\nThe suit of pentacles (or 'coins') in the Tarot deck, the Stone\r\nof Fal (coronation stone of kings) in<BR>\r\nancient Ireland, the sangreal of the Holy Grail processions, and\r\nthe 'Universal Man' of Leonardo<BR>\r\nda Vinci, are all related to the pentagram, stressing its ties\r\nto the earth and nature, making it a<BR>\r\nsymbol par excellence of an earth or nature religion. The five\r\npoints also represent the five<BR>\r\nphysical senses and allude to approaching the spiritual realm\r\nTHROUGH the sensual -- in fact,<BR>\r\nthe meaning of the Ace of Pentacles in Tarot. In numerology, 5\r\nis the number of sexuality,<BR>\r\ncombining the feminine 2 with the masculine 3. Thus, the pentagram\r\nalso represents the<BR>\r\nopposite of asceticism. But wherever the pentagram is displayed,\r\none message is clear:<BR>\r\nevil has no power there.</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE=\"-1\">THE MONEY CANDLE SPELL (How to make a candle)<BR>\r\nItems Needed:<BR>\r\n--2 to 4 pounds of paraffin Thin candlewicking Green candle dye\r\n(or a green crayon)<BR>\r\n--1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon 1/2 tsp. ground nutmeg A small bowl\r\nPatchouli essential oil<BR>\r\n--A large pot A clean coffee can Baking soda (for fire safety)\r\n1 wooden spoon Wax paper<BR>\r\n1. To speed the melting process, grate or chop the paraffin into\r\nsmall pieces before melting.<BR>\r\nFill the large pot about 1/3 full of water. Place on high heat\r\nuntil boiling.<BR>\r\nPlace the paraffin in the coffee can, and set the can into the\r\npot. Turn the heat down to medium.<BR>\r\nWatch the paraffin as it's melting. Paraffin easily bursts into\r\nflames over high heat (this is exactly<BR>\r\nwhy it's used to make candles). If flames appear, place a lid\r\nover the can or drench the area with<BR>\r\nbaking soda to snuff out the fire. If you keep the heat low you\r\nshould have no problems.<BR>\r\n2. While the paraffin is melting, place the two spices into the\r\nbowl. Mix them together, empowering<BR>\r\nthem as you visualize money manifesting in your life. Infuse the\r\nherbs with your goal.<BR>\r\n3. Check the paraffin. For best results, you should have at least\r\n6 inches of melted paraffin.<BR>\r\nIf there's less, add more paraffin. (If the paraffin has melted,\r\nbut has begun to harden, the heat<BR>\r\nis too low. Turn it up a bit.) Add a few chunks of green candle\r\ndye to the paraffin and mix with<BR>\r\nthe wooden spoon. Alternately, remove the paper wrappings from\r\na green crayon, break it into<BR>\r\npieces, and add this to the paraffin. The dye will melt. Stir\r\nuntil the paraffin is evenly colored.<BR>\r\nThe finished, dried candles will be a shade or two lighter than\r\nthe color of the melted paraffin.<BR>\r\nMore dye may be necessary to create the desired dark green shade.<BR>\r\n4. Once the paraffin has been tinted, sprinkle the spices onto\r\nthe paraffin with your projective hand.<BR>\r\nDust off your fingers over the pot and stir the herbs into the\r\nparaffin with the wooden spoon.<BR>\r\nStir clockwise and visualize. Add eight to sixteen drops patchouli\r\nessential oil to the paraffin and<BR>\r\nagain stir with the wooden spoon. Smell the paraffin. It should\r\nbe heavily scented.<BR>\r\nIf not, add more patchouli oil.<BR>\r\n5. Begin dipping. Hold a length of cotton wicking between your\r\nthumb and forefinger.<BR>\r\nDunk it into the paraffin. It will probably just float on the\r\nsurface the first few times you<BR>\r\ndo this, for the wick lacks enough weight to plunge it to the\r\nbottom of the can.<BR>\r\nAfter dipping, remove it and hold it in the air for a moment or\r\ntwo until the paraffin has set,<BR>\r\nthen dip again. Dip again, lifting the wicking completely from\r\nthe melted paraffin, allow<BR>\r\nthe paraffin to set, and re-dip. Repeat as needed.<BR>\r\nThe longer you wait between drippings, allowing the paraffin to\r\nharden, the faster the candle<BR>\r\nwill build up. If you simply dunk and dunk and dunk, the hot paraffin\r\nwill melt each proceeding<BR>\r\ncoat and you'll end up with a soggy piece of wick. With proper\r\ndipping, the candle will soon form.<BR>\r\nIts bottom will grow into an inverted cone-shape from the paraffin\r\nthat drips down the taper's<BR>\r\nsides as it cools. This is natural; don't worry about it.<BR>\r\n6. When the candle has achieved the proper width, hang it dry\r\nin a spot where it won't be<BR>\r\ntouched for several minutes. Test the candle after 20 or so minutes.\r\nThe paraffin should have<BR>\r\nset but the taper should still be warm. Check it periodically\r\nto be sure that it hasn't completely<BR>\r\nhardened before the next step.<BR>\r\n7. Turn off the heat under the paraffin. Place the wax paper on\r\na counter or table.<BR>\r\nLay the candle on the paper and gently, with an easy rocking motion\r\nroll the candle back<BR>\r\nand fourth on the wax paper. This straightens the taper and reduces\r\nirregularities on its surface.<BR>\r\n8. When the candle is fairly straight, cut off the inverted cone\r\nat the bottom of the candle with a<BR>\r\nsharp knife. Dip the taper two more times into the melted paraffin\r\nand hang to dry until hard.<BR>\r\nYou've just made a money candle. (To save time and produce more\r\ntapers, make two, three,<BR>\r\nor four at a time. Hang each to dry as you dip the next.)<BR>\r\n9. To use your Money Spell Candle, choose a time when you'll be\r\nalone.<BR>\r\nSmell the rich, prosperous scent and visualize money manifesting\r\nin your life.<BR>\r\nHold the candle tightly between your palms.<BR>\r\nSend energy into it, saying something like the following words:<BR>\r\n&quot;I charge you by Jupiter, I charge you by the Earth, I charge\r\nyou by the Sun, Moon, and Stars:<BR>\r\nBring money to me, Prosperity.<BR>\r\nMoney to me, Prosperity.<BR>\r\nMoney to me, Prosperity.&quot;<BR>\r\nSet the candle in a holder. Light it.<BR>\r\nSit or stand before it, watching the flame transform the wax into\r\na liquid.<BR>\r\nVisualize the candle releasing the energies that you've placed\r\nwithin it.<BR>\r\nSense it sending out the power to bring your need for money into\r\nmanifestation.<BR>\r\nLet the candle burn down to its end (if in a safe location).<BR>\r\nOr allow it to burn for 4, 8, or 16 minutes daily until your need\r\nmanifests.<BR>\r\nNote: Never blow out the candle. Always use a candle snuffer.<BR>\r\nalways add &quot;May this money come to me without any harm or\r\ndistress to others...&quot;</FONT></P>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT SIZE=\"-1\">PERFUMED INKS<BR>\r\nCan be used when you want to intensify a spell.

Cardinal has an Athame\r\ntucked under his robe belt or in a sheath.<BR>\r\nAthame must be sharpened and cleaned. High Priest makes the sign\r\nof enclosure, the skull-staff<BR>\r\nbetween the hands, base resting on the ground, skull held against\r\nhis bowed head.<BR>\r\nThis gesture is made also by the 9 celebrants. Chant:<BR>\r\n&quot;Tuam es eliciat!&quot; thirteen times, calling forth demonic\r\nlegions. After first recital, the High Priest<BR>\r\nangles the skull towards the center of the circle, the base still\r\nresting on the ground. With each following<BR>\r\nrepetition, one celebrant does the same, in a counter clockwise\r\nmanner. At the tenth repetition, all 10<BR>\r\nmembers of the circle having angled the skull-staff towards the\r\ncenter of the circle, the chant is<BR>\r\nrepeated once more by the High Priest. The Cardinal makes the\r\ncall, followed for a thirteenth time by the<BR>\r\nApostle, who shouts the words into the sky. At this, the Apostle\r\nand the Cardinal hold the skull-staffs<BR>\r\nwith both hands in the air, angled towards the center of the circle.\r\nRevolving counterclockwise around the<BR>\r\ncenter of the circle (the sacrifice), with skull-staff still in\r\nthe center sky, the Cardinal and Apostle make<BR>\r\na 360 revolution.

Pointing their skull-staffs in the Gate\'s opening,\r\nthe Cardinal and Apostle draw the<BR>\r\npower of the portal to their staffs. Simultaneously lowering the\r\nstaffs, they carry the demonic power into<BR>\r\nthis realm and touch the skulls to the infant. All of the demonic\r\npower of the rite is transferred to the babe.<BR>\r\nParticipants begin rapidly chanting &quot;Lucifer,&quot; almost\r\nat a frenzied pace. Apostle and Cardinal both step<BR>\r\nforth and kneel at each side of the babe. Apostle places fingers\r\non infant\'s temples and induces a<BR>\r\ntrance wherein all thought and energy may be transferred. Cardinal\r\ndraws Athame and raises it high<BR>\r\nabove his head, pointing towards the babe. The chanting grows\r\nmore fervent as the Cardinal brings the<BR>\r\nblade down into the chest of the infant nine times, penetrating\r\nher body fully with each strike. After<BR>\r\nthe ninth strike, the Apostle lifts the corpse in both hands and\r\ntears a piece of flesh with his teeth,<BR>\r\nswallowing the infant\'s meat. Calls: &quot;The blood and the flesh\r\nis the soul of the Father!&quot; Holds the<BR>\r\ninfant up to the Cardinal, who partakes of the child\'s flesh.\r\nCardinal remains kneeling while the Apostle<BR>\r\ncarries the babe to the High Priest, who partakes and passes it\r\ncounterclockwise for the others to partake.<BR>\r\nThe babe is put into a shallow grave dug beforehand, and buried.\r\nHigh Priest calls: From dust and ashes<BR>\r\nwert thou borne into this earth by the power and the mercy of\r\nthe Father, and by the very same power and<BR>\r\nmercy has the Father returned thee to dust, and to ashes, unto\r\nthe earth.
